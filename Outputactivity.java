Stop Further Drinking\nLeave the place where the alcohol is, or put the alcohol away.\nCoffee, cold showers, and other traditional remedies don't work\n\n2. Keep the Person Safe\nNever allow someone to drive when they are drunk.\nKeep the person away from machinery, bicycles, skateboards, swimming pools, and other hazards.\nWatch for signs of alcohol poisoning..\n\nAlcohol Intoxication Causes\nAlcohol is a generic term for ethanol, which is a particular type of alcohol produced by the fermentation of many foodstuffs - most commonly barley, hops, and grapes. Other types of alcohol commonly available such as methanol (common in glass cleaners), isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), and ethylene glycol (automobile antifreeze solution) are highly poisonous when swallowed, even in small quantities.\nEthanol produces intoxication because of its depressive effects on various areas of the brain causing the following physical and mental impairments in a progressive order as the persons alcohol level increases (the person becomes more and more intoxicated).\nDisinhibition of normal social functioning\nEuphoria (excessive talking, showing off)\nAtaxia (uncoordinated gait-walking)\nPoor judgment\nLoss of memory\nSlurred speech\nWorsening ataxia\nVomiting\nConfusion and disorientation\nProgressive lethargy and coma\nUltimately the shutdown of the respiratory centers and death\n\nAlcohol Intoxication Signs and Symptoms\nThe effects of alcohol vary widely from person to person. Several factors can account for obvious differences in how certain amounts of alcohol can affect one person more than another. These factors also affect the particular signs and symptoms the person may exhibit to indicate alcohol intoxication.\nMajor factors accounting for this variation in signs and symptoms\n\nPrior experience with alcohol\n A longtime, heavy drinker may achieve blood alcohol concentration levels that would kill the average casual drinker. Conversely, a novice drinker may have severe symptoms with the ingestion of a moderate amount of alcohol. As a person's drinking increases, his/her liver will increase its capacity to metabolize alcohol. In addition, the brain of a heavy drinker becomes used to frequent, even constant, high blood alcohol concentrations. This habituation in a heavy drinker can backfire if this person suddenly stops drinking. The person may go into alcohol withdrawal and develop seizures or a condition called delirium tremens (DTs).\n\nTaking medications\n The effects of alcohol are enhanced if a person is taking other prescription medications, especially those of the sedative class such as sleeping pills or anti-anxiety medications. A person who is not habituated to either alcohol or sedatives may experience serious harm, or even death, if taking prescribed doses. Together, they can be a deadly combination. A person may be taking medications prescribed by a doctor or over-the-counter medications, and may not know about these unintended consequences.\n\nHome Care for Alcohol IntoxicationThe majority of people with simple alcohol intoxication can be cared for by a friend or relative at home.\nRemove the person from all sources of alcohol. Remove the person from the bar or party. If in a home environment, get rid of all the alcohol.\nProvide a safe environment (prevent falls, keep away from dangerous machines and objects, keep from driving vehicles).\nFind out if only ethanol has been ingested. Determine if the person has taken any medications, illegal drugs, or nonethanol alcohols.\nSee if the person is easy to arouse when spoken to or with a slight shake of a shoulder.\nMake sure that the person's condition is not due to an underlying medical cause or injury. Ask about other conditions and look for any evidence of a head injury or other trauma.\nHave someone in constant attendance to ensure that the person is improving, and to obtain medical assistance as needed. If the person does not feel comfortable monitoring the condition of the intoxicated person, then it would be best to take the person to the hospital.\nNo medications will speed up the sobering process. Caffeine by drinking coffee and cold showers have a minimal and very temporary effect.\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Care\nIf all home care conditions cannot be assured, or if a caretaker feels uncomfortable monitoring the intoxicated person, or if there is any doubt about the person's condition, then take the person to the nearest hospital's emergency department. In addition, the person may need medical attention to address chronic medical conditions unrelated to the alcohol intoxication. These could be conditions such as diabetes, renal (kidney) failure, or epilepsy ", "\n\nCall doctor for immediate help if the person\nif the person has had severe reactions in the past or has any of these symptoms\nDifficulty breathing or wheezing\nTightness in the throat or a feeling that the airways are closing\nHoarseness or trouble speaking\nSwollen lips, tongue, or throat\nNausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting\nFast heartbeat or pulse\nAnxiety or dizziness\nLoss of consciousness\nOther symptoms of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\nIf you have severe allergies, you should keep two epinephrine injection kits with you at all times and readily available. If you experience any sign of anaphylaxis, do not hesitate to use the autoinjector even if those symptoms do not appear to be allergy related. Using the autoinjector as a precaution will not harm you. Call 911 even if you administer the injection.\n1. Treat Symptoms\nFor mild allergy symptoms, such as hay fever or hives, give an over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamine.\nFor stuffy nose, give an OTC decongestant.\nFor itchy, watery eyes, use OTC allergy eye drops.\nFor itchy allergic rash, apply cold compresses and an OTC hydrocortisone cream.\n\n2. Follow Up\nWatch for worsening symptoms, including signs of anaphylaxis.\n\nSevere Allergic Reaction Treatment\n1. Seek emergency care\nGet immediate help if the person has these symptoms or a history of severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) even if there are no symptoms\nDifficulty breathing or wheezing\nTightness in the throat or a feeling that the airways are closing\nHoarseness or trouble speaking\nSwollen lips, tongue, or throat\nNausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting\nFast heartbeat or pulse\nSkin that itches, tingles, swells, or develops raised red areas (hives)\nAnxiety or dizziness\nLoss of consciousness\n2. Inject Epinephrine Immediately\nInject immediately at first sign of anaphylaxis. The injection cannot harm them if it is a false alarm, but could save their life. If the person has an anaphylaxis action plan from a doctor for injecting epinephrine and other emergency measures, follow it.\nOtherwise, if the person carries an epinephrine shot -- it's a good idea to always carry two shots -- or one is available\nInject epinephrine if the person is unable to.\nIf the person has a history of anaphylaxis, don't wait for signs of a severe reaction to inject epinephrine.\nRead and follow patient instructions carefully.\nInject epinephrine into outer muscle of the thigh. Avoid injecting into a vein or buttock muscles.\nDo not inject medicine into hands or feet, which can cause tissue damage. If this happens, notify the emergency room staff.\nThe person may need more than one injection if there’s no improvement after the first. For an adult, inject again after 5 to 15 minutes. For a child, inject again after 5 to 20 minutes.\n3. Do CPR if the Person Stops Breathing\nFor a child, start CPR for children.\nFor an adult, start adult CPR.\n4. Follow Up\nMake sure that someone stays with the person for 24 hours after anaphylaxis in case of another attack.\nReport the reaction to the person's doctor.\n\nAllergic reactions can be triggered by foods, medications, insect stings, pollen, or other substances. Although most allergic reactions aren't serious, severe reactions can be life threatening and require immediate medical attention.\n\nSigns and Symptoms\nMild\nitchiness\nskin redness\nslight swelling\nstuffy, runny nose\nsneezing\nitchy, watery eyes\nred bumps (hives) anywhere on the body\n\nSevere:\nswelling of the mouth or tongue\ndifficulty swallowing or speaking\nwheezing or difficulty breathing\nabdominal (belly) pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea\ndizziness or fainting\n\nWhat to Do\nContact a doctor if your child has an allergic reaction that is more than mild or concerns you.\nIf the symptoms are mild, give an oral antihistamine such as diphenhydramine.\nIf the symptoms are severe and you have injectable epinephrine (EpiPen), immediately use it as directed and call for emergency medical help.\n\nThink Prevention!\n\nHave kids avoid substances that are known to trigger an allergic reaction. Keep an oral antihistamine such as diphenhydramine available.\nIf your child has a severe allergy, be sure doctor-prescribed injectable epinephrine is kept nearby at all times, and that you, your child (if old enough), and anyone who cares for your child know how to use it.", "\n\nAltitude/Mountain Sickness Treatment\n\nMild altitude sickness or acute mountain sickness\nSymptoms may include\nFatigue\nHeadache\nLoss of appetite\nNausea\nSleep problems\nSwelling of arms and legs\nVomiting\nWeakness\n\nSevere altitude sickness, high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE)\nSymptoms may also include\nShortness of breath at rest, fast heart beat, dry cough, pink frothy phlegm or sputum, or crackling sound in lungs (HAPE)\nSevere headache, altered vision, disorientation, hallucinations, seizures, and coma (HACE)1. Descend to Lower Altitude\nFor mild acute mountain sickness, the person may be able to stay at current altitude to see if his or her body adjusts. If symptoms don’t get better in 24 to 48 hours or if they get worse, the person should go down to a lower altitude and seek immediate medical care.\nFor severe symptoms, the person should immediately be taken down 1,500 to 2,000 feet with as little exertion as possible. Keep going down until symptoms go away. Get medical help right away as waiting could cause serious problems or even death.\nEven if symptoms are mild, the person should not go any higher in altitude until symptoms are completely gone.\n\n2. Treat Symptoms\nive oxygen, if available.\nKeep the person warm and have him or her rest.\nGive plenty of liquids.\nGive acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for headache.\n\n3. See a Health Care Provider\nIf mild symptoms persist after descent, call a health care provider.\nFor severe symptoms, the person should see a doctor as soon as possible, even if symptoms go away after descent.\n\nMore about high-altitude illness \n\nWhat causes high-altitude illness?\nThe low amount of oxygen in the air at high altitudes causes high-altitude illness. The amount of oxygen in the air goes down as you climb higher above sea level and becomes very low at altitudes above 8,000 feet. If you travel to a high altitude, you may feel ill because the air has less oxygen in it. If you stay at a high altitude for a long time, your body gets used to the low oxygen level, and you don't get sick from it.\nThere are three main types of high-altitude illness: (1) acute mountain sickness (also called AMS), (2) high-altitude pulmonary edema (also called HAPE), which affects the lungs, and (3) high-altitude cerebral edema (also called HACE), which affects the brain. These illnesses can be serious, but they can also be prevented.\n\nHow can I prevent high-altitude illness?\nYou can do two important things to prevent high-altitude illness: (1) take your time traveling to higher altitudes and (2) sleep at an altitude that is lower than the altitude you were in during the day. For example, if you ski at an elevation of 10,000 feet during the day, sleep the night before and the night after at an elevation of 8,500 feet.\nWhen you travel to a high altitude, your body will begin adjusting right away to the amount of oxygen in the air, but it takes several days for your body to adjust completely. If you're healthy, you can probably go safely from sea level to an altitude of 8,000 feet in a few days. But when you reach an altitude above 8,000 feet, don't go up faster than 1,000 feet per day. The closer you live to sea level, the more time your body will need to get used to a high altitude. Plan your trip so your body has time to get used to the high altitude before you start your physical activity\n\nHow do I know if I am getting a high-altitude illness?\nSome of the first signs of high-altitude illness are headache, lightheadedness, weakness, trouble sleeping and an upset stomach. If you have these symptoms, stop going up to a higher altitude or go back down to a lower altitude until your symptoms go away. More severe symptoms include difficulty breathing while you're resting, coughing, confusion and inability to walk in a straight line. If you get these symptoms, go to a lower altitude right away and get help from a doctor.\n\nWhat should I do if I get high-altitude illness?\nThe best treatment for any of the three high-altitude illnesses is to go down to a lower altitude right away. But if you have only mild symptoms, you may be able to stay at that altitude and let your body adjust. If you do this, don't exercise at all, just rest until you feel better.\nIf you have severe symptoms, go down 1,500 to 2,000 feet right away to see if your symptoms get better. Keep going down until your symptoms go away completely.\n medicine called acetazolamide (brand name: Diamox) can be used to treat high-altitude illness. When you talk with your doctor about your upcoming trip, ask about getting a prescription for this medicine to take with you in case you get mountain sickness. If you start to have symptoms of high-altitude illness, you can take 125 to 250 mg of the medicine by mouth twice a day.\nDon't ignore signs of high-altitude illnesss. People can die of high-altitude illness if they don't recognize the signs or if they don't believe their illness is caused by the high altitude. When you have signs of high-altitude illness, don't go to a higher altitude until you feel better and your symptoms have completely gone away.", "\nAnkle Fracture Treatment\n\nCall doctor for immediate help if the person\nIs bleeding uncontrollably\nHas a numb, cold, pale, or blue ankle/foot\nIs unable to move the foot\nIs in shock (faint, pale, with rapid shallow breathing)\n\n1. Leave Protruding Bone Alone\nIf a bone has broken through the skin, don't push it back into place. Cover the area with a clean bandage and seek immediate medical attention.\n\n2. Stop Bleeding\nApply steady, direct pressure with a cloth for 15 minutes and elevate the wound. If blood soaks through, apply another cloth over the first and seek immediate medical attention.\n\n3. Control Swelling\nRemove ankle bracelets or toe rings.\nIf medical attention is not immediately available, apply RICE therapy\nRest ankle by having the person stay off of it. Use crutches if necessary.\nIce area. Use an ice pack or wrap the ice in a clean cloth. Do not place ice directly against the skin.\nCompress by wrapping ankle lightly (not tightly) with an ace bandage or elastic ankle brace. Do not try to align the bones.\nElevate ankle above heart level.\n\n4. Manage Pain and Inflammation\nGive an over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or aspirin. Avoid ibuprofen and other NSAIDs if the person has heart failure or kidney failure. Do NOT give aspirin to anyone ages 18 or younger.\n\n5. See a Doctor as Soon as Possible\n\n6. Follow Up\nThe doctor will examine and X-ray the ankle, leg, and foot. The doctor also may do a CT or CAT scan, or an MRI to determine if surgery is needed.If needed, the doctor will set the broken bone back in place and immobilize the ankle with a splint, cast, or other device. Surgery may be necessary to repair the break.More about Ankle Fractures\n\nAnkle Fractures (Broken Ankle)\nA broken ankle is also known as an ankle fracture. This means that one or more of the bones that make up the ankle joint are broken.\nA fractured ankle can range from a simple break in one bone, which may not stop you from walking, to several fractures, which forces your ankle out of place and may require that you not put weight on it for a few months.\nSimply put, the more bones that are broken, the more unstable the ankle becomes. There may be ligaments damaged as well. The ligaments of the ankle hold the ankle bones and joint in position.\nBroken ankles affect people of all ages. During the past 30 to 40 years, doctors have noted an increase in the number and severity of broken ankles, due in part to an active, older population of baby boomers.\n\nAnatomy\nThree bones make up the ankle joint\nTibia - shinbone\nFibula - smaller bone of the lower leg\nTalus - a small bone that sits between the heel bone (calcaneus) and the tibia and fibula\n\nThe tibia and fibula have specific parts that make up the ankle\nMedial malleolus - inside part of the tibia\nPosterior malleolus - back part of the tibia\nLateral malleolus - end of the fibula\nDoctors classify ankle fractures according to the area of bone that is broken. For example, a fracture at the end of the fibula is called a lateral malleolus fracture, or if both the tibia and fibula are broken, it is called a bimalleolar fracture.\nTwo joints are involved in ankle fractures\nAnkle joint - where the tibia, fibula, and talus meet\nSyndesmosis joint - the joint between the tibia and fibula, which is held together by ligaments\nMultiple ligaments help make the ankle joint stable.\n\nSymptoms\nBecause a severe ankle sprain can feel the same as a broken ankle, every ankle injury should be evaluated by a physician.\nCommon symptoms for a broken ankle include\nImmediate and severe pain\nSwelling\nBruising\nTender to touch\nCannot put any weight on the injured foot\nDeformity (out of place), particularly if the ankle joint is dislocated as well", "\n\nCall doctor for immediate help if the personSymptoms of acute attack include difficulty talking or walking because of shortness of breath or lips or fingernails turning blue.\n\n1. Follow the Person’s Asthma Plan, if Possible\nFind out if the person has an individualized asthma action plan from a health care provider.\nIf so, follow its directions for giving asthma medication and seeking medical help for acute asthma attack.\n\n2. Give Asthma First Aid\nIf the person doesn't have an asthma plan\nSit the person upright comfortably and loosen tight clothing\nIf the person has asthma medication, such as an inhaler, assist in using it.\nIf the person doesn’t have an inhaler, use one from a first aid kit or borrow someone else’s.\n\n3. Use Inhaler With a Spacer, if Possible\nRemove cap and shake inhaler well.\nInsert inhaler into spacer.\nHave the person breathe out completely and put mouth tightly around spacer mouthpiece.\nPress inhaler once to deliver a puff.\nHave the person breathe in slowly through the mouth and then hold breath for 10 seconds.\nGive a total of four puffs, waiting about a minute between each puff.\n\n4. Use Inhaler Without a Spacer, if Necessary\nRemove the inhaler cap and shake well.\nHave the person breathe out all the way and seal lips tightly around inhaler mouthpiece.\nAs the person starts to breathe in slowly, press down on inhaler one time.\nThe person should keep breathing in as slowly and deeply as possible (about five to seven seconds) and then hold breath for 10 seconds.\nGive a total of four puffs, waiting about one minute between each puff.\n\n5. Continue Using Inhaler if Breathing Is Still a Problem\nAfter four puffs, wait four minutes. If the person still has trouble breathing, give another set of four puffs.\nIf there’s still little or no improvement, give four puffs every four minutes until ambulance arrives. If the person is having a severe attack, give up to six to eight puffs every five minutes.\n\n6. Monitor the Person Until Help Arrives\nDo not mistake drowsiness as a sign of improvement; it could mean asthma is worsening.\nDo not assume the person’s asthma is improving if you no longer hear wheezing.\n\n7. Follow UpAn emergency room doctor will check the severity of the attack and provide treatment, including medications.\nThe person may be discharged home or hospitalized for further care, depending on response to treatment.\n\nMore about Asthma Attack\n\nYou have increasing wheezing, cough, chest tightness or\nshortness of breath\nYou are waking often at night with asthma symptoms\nYou need to use your reliever again within 3 hours\nThis is an asthma attack\n\nAsthma Emergency - DANGER SIGNS\nYour symptoms get worse very quickly\nYou have severe shortness of breath, can’t speak comfortably\nor lips look blue\nYou get little or no relief from your reliever inhaler\nCall an ambulance immediately\n\nNot sure if it's Asthma?\nIf a person stays conscious and their main problem seems to be breathing, follow the asthma first aid steps. Asthma reliever medicine is unlikely to harm them even if they do not have asthma.\n\nSevere Allergic Reactions\nFollow the person’s Action Plan for Anaphylaxis if available. If the person has known severe allergies and seems to be having a severe allergic reaction, use their adrenaline autoinjector (e.g. EpiPen, Anapen) before giving asthma reliever medicine.\n\nAsthma prevention\nAdvising patients about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of strategies for preventing children from developing asthma, including prenatal care, infant feeding and allergen avoidance, and strategies for preventing adult-onset asthma\n\nPreventive care\nAdvising patients about lifestyle factors (smoking, nutrition, physical activity and healthy weight) that may affect asthma, and special considerations for immunisation and general health care for people with asthma\n\nWhat Causes Asthma?While there is no known specific cause of asthma, what all people with asthma have in common is chronic airway inflammation. Their airways are highly sensitive to various triggers. When their airways come into contact with a trigger, the airways become inflamed (they fill with mucus, swell, and narrow). Then muscles within the airways contract, causing even further narrowing of the airways. This makes breathing difficult and results in an asthma attack.\nTriggers are different for different individuals. Common ones include the following\nExposure to tobacco smoke\nBreathing polluted air\nInhaling irritants such as perfume and cleaning products\nAllergens such as molds, dust, and animal dander\nExposure to cold, dry weather\nStress\nExercise or physical exertion\nMedications including aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen\nAn upper respiratory infection such as a cold, flu, or bronchitis\nSulfites (additives to some foods and wines)\n\nChanges in weather can also trigger asthma attacks because of the irritants and allergens stirred up by wind and rain.\nAsthma is on the rise in the United States and other developed countries. While the reasons are not clear, the following factors may contribute to the rise\nSpending more time indoors where exposure to indoor allergens such as dust and mold and some chemicals from building materials is greater\nLiving in cleaner conditions than people did in the past, which makes our immune systems more sensitive (reactive) to triggers\nExposure to increased air pollution\nIncreased physical inactivity (lack of exercise)\n\nWhat Are Medications for Asthma?\nThere are two types of asthma medications.\nController medications are for long-term control of persistent asthma. They help reduce the inflammation in the lungs that is behind asthma attacks. Controller medications should be taken every day whether someone is having symptoms or not. Controller medications include inhaled corticosteroids (the main type of medication), leukotriene inhibitors, methylxanthines, and cromolyn sodium.\nRescue medications are taken after an asthma attack has begun. They stop the attack. Rescue medications include beta-agonists and anticholinergics, as well as systemic (pills or injectable) corticosteroids.\nKnowing which medication is which is very important because a controller medication will not give immediate relief if someone is having an asthma attack.\nController medications should not be stopped just because a person feels fine and has not had an asthma attack for a while. Feeling fine usually means that the controller is working to keep airways free from inflammation. Also, if a controller medication is stopped and a person starts experiencing asthma symptoms again, those symptoms are harder to control. If the controller medication seems to have stopped symptoms, a person can talk to his or her doctor about changing the dose or medication.\nTalking with a doctor about possible side effects is important.\nFor some people, allergy shots can help control asthma symptoms.\nFor more complete information on medications, visit Understanding Asthma Medications.\n\\nFor both controller and rescue inhaler medications to be effective, they need to be properly administered so that the medication can reach the deeper parts of the lungs where they are needed. It is important to receive teaching from a health-care provider in the correct use of handheld inhaler devices.", "\nAcute Asthma Attack Treatment for Children\n\nCall doctor for immediate help if the Child is\nHaving a hard time breathing\nConstantly coughing\nUnable to talk, eat, or play\nVomiting\nTurning blue in the lips or fingers\nConvulsing while breathing (using stomach muscles excessively to breathe)\nIf he does not have the above symptoms but is still complaining of trouble breathing or coughing, do the following\n\n1. Notify the Child’s Health Care Provider Immediately\n\n2. Follow the Child’s Asthma Plan, if Possible\nFind out if the child has an individualized asthma action plan from a health care provider.\nIf so, follow directions for giving asthma medication and seeking medical help for acute asthma attack.\nBring a copy of the child’s asthma action plan to show the ER staff.\n\n3. Give Quick-Relief Medicine\nIf the child has no asthma action plan but has an inhaler\nSit child upright comfortably and loosen tight clothing.\nGive one puff of quick-relief medicine from child's inhaler, always with a spacer.\nAsk child to take four breaths from spacer.\nGive three more puffs, with four breaths between each.\nWait four minutes. If there’s no improvement, give another four puffs.\nIf the child doesn’t have an inhaler, use one from a first aid kit. If you are sure this is an asthma attack and the child has used quick-relief asthma medicine before (albuterol), you can borrow someone else’s.\n\nFollow Up\nAn emergency room doctor will check the severity of the attack and provide treatment, including medication.\nThe child may be discharged home or hospitalized for further care, depending on response to treatment.\n\nMorea about Asthma Attack Treatment for Children \nOne of the main goals of parents whose kids have asthma is avoiding trips to the emergency room (ER) for breathing problems. But it's also important to know when going to the ER is the right choice.\nYou'll be better prepared to make that decision if you discuss it with your doctor before your child has a severe flare-up. The doctor's instructions should be included in the asthma action plan. The plan will list specific symptoms that are your cue to go to the ER. If old enough, your child also should know what these signs are.\nKnow the Early Signs of a Flare-Up\nEveryone's asthma is different. Some kids cough only at night, while others have flare-ups whenever they get a cold or exercise outside.\nAs you manage your child's asthma, pay attention to what happens before a flare-up so that you know the early warning signs. These signs might not mean that a flare-up definitely will happen, but they can help you to plan ahead.\n\nEarly warning signs of a flare-up can include\nwheezing\ncoughing that's not due to a cold or a persistent cough\ntightness in the chest\nthroat clearing\nrapid or irregular breathing\nshortness of breath with activities\ninability to stand or sit still\nunusual fatigue\nrestless sleep\nCommunicate with your doctor. Be sure to call the doctor at the earliest sign of a flare-up or if you have any other concerns. Being prepared means you might prevent your child's symptoms from getting worse and can make a trip to the doctor's office instead of to the ER.\n\nWhen to Seek Help\nSometimes your child must receive medical care very quickly. If any of the following symptoms happen, see your doctor immediately, go to the ER, or call an ambulance\nif your child is having constant wheezing\nif your child uses quick-relief medicines (also called rescue or fast-acting medicines) repeatedly for severe flare-up symptoms that don't go away after 5 or 10 minutes or return again quickly\nif there are changes in your child's color, like bluish or gray lips and fingernails\nif your child is having trouble talking\nif the areas below the ribs, between the ribs, and in the neck visibly pull in during inhalation (called retractions)\nif your child's peak flow reading falls below 50% (which is in the red zone of the peak flow) and doesn't improve after using medicine\n\nMaking ER Trips Less Stressful\nPlanning can make trips to the ER less stressful for you and your child. Here are some tips to try\nKnow the location of your closest ER. If there's a children's hospital ER nearby, go there and have the address and phone number handy (written on the asthma action plan, for instance).\nIf you have other kids, try to make arrangements with a relative or other caregiver who can take them in an emergency. But don't let the lack of a babysitter delay your trip to the ER. Someone can always come to the hospital later to pick up your other kids.\nTake a copy of your child's asthma action plan or a note with the names and dosages of any medicines your child takes to share with the medical staff at the ER.Following the Asthma Action Plan\n\nWell-managed asthma is rarely life threatening. People who have died from asthma usually hadn't taken their medicines as prescribed and had a history of repeated severe asthma flare-ups and emergency care.\nIf you and your child take asthma seriously and work to manage it, you can lessen the chances that your child will need to go to the ER.It's important to monitor your child's asthma using the written asthma action plan your doctor helps you create. This plan will outline day-to-day treatment, symptoms to watch for, and step-by-step instructions to follow during a flare-up.", "\nAcute Asthma Attack in Pregnancy Treatment\n\nCall doctor for immediate help if the person is\n\n1. Symptoms of an acute asthma attack in pregnancy include\nDifficulty talking, walking, or thinking because of shortness of breath\nNeck and ribs moving in during breathing\nBlue- or gray-looking skin\nPeak flow reading below 60% of personal best\nDecrease in fetal kick count if the baby is in distress\n\n2. Follow the Woman’s Asthma Plan, if Possible\nFind out if the woman has an individualized treatment plan for asthma attack in pregnancy from a health care provider.\nFollow the plan. It may say to call the woman's health care provider about when to give quick-relief medicine and whether additional medicines are needed.\n\n3. Give Asthma First Aid\nIf the woman doesn't have an asthma action plan\nSit the woman upright comfortably and loosen tight clothing.\nIf woman has asthma medication, such as an inhaler, help her use it.\nIf woman doesn't have an inhaler, use one from a first aid kit or borrow someone else’s.\n\n4. Use Inhaler With a Spacer, if Possible\nRemove cap and shake inhaler well.\nInsert inhaler into spacer.\nHave her breathe out completely and put mouth tightly around spacer mouthpiece.\nPress inhaler once to deliver a puff.\nHave her breathe in slowly through the mouth and then hold breath for 10 seconds.\nGive a total of four puffs, waiting about a minute between each puff.\n\n5. Use Inhaler Without a Spacer, if Necessary\nRemove cap and shake inhaler well.\nHave woman breathe out all the way and seal lips tightly around inhaler mouthpiece.\nAs woman starts to breathe in slowly, press down on the inhaler one time.\nHave her keep breathing in as slowly and deeply as possible (about five to seven seconds) and then hold breath for 10 seconds.\nGive a total of four puffs, waiting about one minute between each puff.\n\n6. Continue Using Inhaler if Breathing Is Still a Problem\nAfter four puffs, wait four minutes. If the woman still has trouble breathing, give another set of four puffs.\nIf there’s still little or no improvement, continue giving four puffs every four minutes until ambulance arrives.\nIf the woman is having a severe attack, give up to six to eight puffs every five minutes.\n\n7. Monitor the Woman Until Help Arrives\nDo not mistake drowsiness as a sign of improvement; it could mean asthma is worsening.\nDo not assume her asthma is improving if you no longer hear wheezing.\n\n8. Follow Up\nAn emergency room doctor may give the woman oxygen, inhaled medications, and intravenous steroids. All can be given without risk to the baby.\nThe woman may be hospitalized so that she can be carefully monitored.\n\nMore about Asthma and Pregnancy\nEarly awareness of asthma symptoms and peak flow monitoring can help you and your doctor respond quickly to worsening of your asthma during pregnancy. It is important to identify and treat your asthma when the symptoms are still mild, so as to reduce the risk of a more serious episode. Common asthma symptoms may vary from person to person and include\nCough\nShortness of breath\nTightness in the chest\nWheeze\nShortness of breath\nMany of these symptoms are common during pregnancy, and it sometimes may be difficult to tell if the cause is the increasing size of your baby or your asthma. A peak flow meter may enable you to tell the difference. A peak flow meter measures the airflow out of your lungs and can sometimes show a decrease hours or even a day before other asthma symptoms appear. Ask your doctor about using a peak flow meter to help monitor your asthma.\n\nAsthma Action Plan for Your Pregnancy\nAn asthma action plan is a written plan based on changes in asthma symptoms and peak flow numbers, customized to your needs by your doctor to help you manage asthma worsening. It will give you information about when and how to use long-term control medicine and quick-relief medicine. It is a reminder of what to watch for and what steps to take so you will be able to make timely and appropriate decisions about managing your asthma during your pregnancy. Print a copy of our Asthma Symptom Action Plan (PDF) for you and your doctor. \n\nSevere Asthma Episodes During Pregnancy\nWhen asthma symptoms and low peak flow numbers indicate your asthma is worsening, it is important to take action to ensure you and your baby receive enough oxygen. A severe asthma attack is a true medical emergency and you should seek medical assistance immediately. A small number of women with asthma may have an asthma episode severe enough to be hospitalized so that you and your baby can be closely monitored. A severe asthma attack is a true medical emergency and you should seek medical assistance immediately. Your treatment may include oxygen, frequent inhaled medications, and IV steroids, all of which can be given without risk to your baby.\n\nAsthma Management During Labor and Delivery\nIt is important to continue long-term control medicines and have quick-relief medicines available throughout labor and delivery. Your breathing will be closely monitored as will your baby's heart rate with a fetal monitor to make sure that he or she is not showing signs of distress. Plan ahead and discuss these decisions and potential problems with your healthcare providers. This will help decrease fears and problems that may arise once labor begins.\nBring your own medications to the hospital, so everyone will understand what you have been taking. The hospital will then provide whatever medication is needed.\nTalk with your healthcare provider about pain control during delivery before your delivery date. If anesthesia is required, spinal anesthesia is preferred to general (gas) anesthesia. If you receive anesthesia of this form, you may be able to use your inhaled medicine as directed by your doctor. If a Cesarean-section is required you may need IV steroids.\n\nBreastfeeding When You Have Asthma\nResearch shows that breastfeeding for the first 6-12 months of life may help prevent or delay the development of certain allergies. The decision to breastfeed should be based on what you desire and your baby's needs. The medicines safe for use during pregnancy are generally used while breastfeeding without problems. Because your blood stream absorbs less medicine with inhaled medicine, less medicine passes into your breast milk. It is important to discuss your use of any medicines with your baby's doctor.", "\n\nBlack Eye Treatment\n\n1. Treat Symptoms\nApply ice to the area. Don't press on the eye.\nFor pain, give acetaminophen (Tylenol). Don't give aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), because they can increase bleeding.\n\n2. Get Medical Help\nSee a health care provider to make sure there is no further damage to the eye.\n\nCall a health care provider immediately if\nThe person's vision is blurred, double, or lost in either eye.\nThe person is in severe pain.\nYou suspect a serious eye injury.\nThere is drainage or bleeding on the white part of the eye or drainage from the eye.\nThe eyeball or pupil looks abnormal.\nSkin around the eye is split or there is a cut on the eyelid.\n\n3. Follow Up\nContinue icing the area several times a day for 1 or 2 days.\nAfter 1 or 2 days, apply warm compresses to the bruised area instead.\nDepending on the injury, the provider may prescribe eye drops and recommend follow up with an eye doctor.More about Black eye and eye injuriesEye injuries are the most common preventable cause of blindness. While many minor eye irritations can be treated at home by flushing the eye with water, more serious injuries need medical attention. So when in doubt, err on the side of caution and call your doctor for help.\n\nWhat to Do:\nRoutine Irritations\n(sand, dirt, and other foreign bodies on the eye surface)\nWash your hands thoroughly before touching the eyelids to examine or flush the eye.\nDo not touch, press, or rub the eye itself, and do whatever you can to keep your child from touching it (a baby can be swaddled to prevent this).\nDo not try to remove any foreign body except by flushing. Other methods can scratch the surface of the eye, especially the cornea.\nTilt your child's head over a basin or sink with the affected eye down and gently pull down the lower lid. Encourage your child to open the eyes as wide as possible. For an infant or small child, it's helpful to have a second person hold the child's eyes open while you flush.\nGently pour a steady stream of lukewarm water (do not heat the water) from a pitcher or faucet over the eye.\nFlush for up to 15 minutes, checking the eye every 5 minutes to see if the foreign body has been flushed out.\nBecause a particle can scratch the cornea and cause an infection, the eye should be examined by a doctor if irritation continues after flushing.\nA foreign body that remains after flushing probably will require removal by a trained medical professional.\n\nEmbedded Foreign Body\n(an object penetrates or enters the globe of the eye)\nIf an object, such as a piece of glass or metal, is sticking out of the eye, take the following steps\nCall for emergency medical help or bring the child to the emergency room.\nCover the affected eye with a small cup taped in place. The point is to keep all pressure off the eye.\nKeep your child (and yourself) as calm and comfortable as possible until help arrives.\n\nA blunt impact may damage the\nStructures at the front of the eye (the eyelid, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, iris, and lens)\nStructures at the back of the eye (retina and optic nerve)\nStructures surrounding the eye (see Black Eye and see Fractures of the Orbit)\n\nBlunt impact can cause bruising (contusion) and cuts (lacerations) to the tissues of the eye. Bleeding in the back section of the eye (vitreous hemorrhage), tearing of the iris, displacement (dislocation) of the lens, and breaking (fracturing) the bones that surround the eye (orbital fracture) usually require a high energy (very forceful) impact.\n\nIf the impact was high energy, affected people tend to have obvious, severe eye injuries with many abnormalities. Examination by an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in the evaluation and treatment—surgical and nonsurgical—of eye disorders) and treatment should occur as soon as possible. Injured eyes may be very swollen and difficult to open, but doctors need to open the eyes to examine them and determine what injuries will need treatment. The eyes almost always can be opened gently, although instruments may be needed to do so\n\nIn the first 24 hours after a blunt eye injury, blood may leak into the skin of the eyelid and surrounding areas, causing swelling and a bruise (contusion), commonly called a black eye. The blood usually drains toward the bottom of the eye after a day or two, resulting in swelling and discoloration just below the lower eyelid. Black eyes themselves have no effect on vision, although other eye injuries that accompany them may be serious.\nBlack eyes resolve without treatment after a few days or weeks. During the first 24 to 48 hours, ice packs may help reduce swelling and ease the pain of a black eye. After the first 24 to 48 hours, warm compresses may be applied to aid absorption of the blood.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen) or acetaminophen can be given if the pain is significant. However, people who have bleeding within the eye should probably use acetaminophen and not use NSAIDs, which may worsen bleeding.", "\nBlack Widow Spider Bite Treatment\n\nCall doctor for immediate help if the person is\nHas trouble breathing\nShows signs of shock\n\n1. Get Help Immediately\nCall your health care provider or go to a hospital emergency room.\nIf possible, kill the spider and take it to the doctor with you.\nSymptoms include target-like marking and slight swelling at wound site, muscle pains and cramps within 2 hours of the bite, weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating, dizziness, itching, anxiety, and increased blood pressure.\n\n2. Treat Symptoms\nApply ice on the way to the health care provider's office or emergency room to relieve pain and swelling\n\n2. Treat Symptoms\nApply ice on the way to the health care provider's office or emergency room to relieve pain and swelling\n\n3. Follow Up\nThe health care provider will examine and clean the wound.\nThe person may require a tetanus shot or booster, depending on the date of the last injection.\nA person with severe symptoms -- such as intense pain and cramping or high blood pressure -- may be admitted to the hospital. Antivenin may be needed.\n\nA Comparison of the Brown Recluse & the Black Widow Spider Bites\nAll spiders have hollow fangs to inject venom into their victims---usually other insects---but in most species, the fangs are too short or too fragile to break human skin. The brown recluse spider and the black widow spider are among the very few species that can bite humans and inject dangerous venom.\n\nIdentification\nThe brown recluse spider has three pairs of eyes and an upside down violin-shaped marking down its back. They live only in the Midwest. Black widow spiders are shiny with a distinctive red hourglass shape on the under-side of their abdomens. Black widows live in warm climates.\n\nBite\nYou might not realize that you have been bitten until symptoms develop. The bites from a brown recluse and a black widow look similar, like a target or bull's eye, centered at the site where the fangs penetrated. The California Poison Control System says that in the case of a black widow bite, a red ring surrounds a pale center while in the case of a brown recluse bite, the center forms a blister, surrounded by a red ring and then a pale ring.\n\nSymptoms\nWithin about 10 minutes, pain, burning and itching develop at the site of a brown recluse bite. Within 24 to 48 hours, an itchy red rash appears over the whole body. Depending on the amount of venom injected, you might also suffer from fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, muscle aches and destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia). The blister in the center of the bite can break and form an ulcer (necrotize). A deep ulcer can involve muscles, causing serious pain. According to the California Poison Control System, the greatest risk from a brown recluse bite comes from an infected ulcer.\nBlack widows do not always inject venom when they bite, says the California Poison Control System. Symptoms of a venomous bite develop within about two hours and include severe muscle cramps in the back, shoulders, abdomen and thighs; weakness, nausea, sweating, headache, difficulty breathing and high blood pressure. These symptoms result from the venom itself.\n\nTreatment\nUsually, venomous spider bites do not require treatment beyond washing the area and applying antibiotic ointment. You can elevate and immobilize the site of the bite to minimize the spread of venom.\nAccording to Dr. Swanson in the February 2005 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, no one treatment for brown recluse bites has been proven effective, and most bites heal on their own. If the ulcer from a brown recluse bite becomes deep or infected, you might need to take antibiotics. Occasionally, people with very deep ulcers require surgery. \nIf you develop cramps after a black widow bite, you should go to the hospital. Black widow anti-venin can treat the symptoms, but it is rarely needed because other medications can treat the symptoms, says the California Poison Control System.", "\n\nTreating Broken Arms in Children\nCall Doctor if\nThe bone has broken through the skin.\nThe arm is bleeding heavily.The arm is numb, white, or blue.\nThere is deformity to the arm.\n\nAs long as you get medical treatment right away, a broken arm usually heals well.\nCall Doctor If\nYou think your child has a broken arm. Symptoms include pain, redness, swelling, and refusal to move the arm.\n\n1. Examine the Injury\nDo not try to straighten the arm.\nIf the bone has broken through the skin, do not touch it. Drape gauze or a clean diaper over the injury, apply pressure to control the bleeding, and get emergency help.\n\n2. Make a Splint\nDon't try to straighten the arm. Try to keep it still and don't move it.\nPut some soft padding around the arm, like a soft cloth.\nSplint the wrapped arm with a ruler, newspaper, or magazine to keep it from moving too much.\nGently wrap cloth or tape around the splint and wrapping to hold them together.\nMake sure the splint and wrapping aren't cutting off circulation.\n\n3. Get Help\nIf your child may have a broken arm, go to the pediatrician's office or the emergency room.\n\n4. Reduce Swelling and Pain\nWhile waiting to see a doctor, put a wrapped ice pack or ice in a towel on the arm for a few minutes at a time.\nIf possible, keep your child's arm elevated.\nCheck with a doctor before using any pain reliever.More about Children And Broken Bones\n\nHow can I tell if my child has broken a bone?\nAlthough the term fracture may sound serious, it is just another name for a broken bone. As you probably remember from your own childhood, fractures are very common. In fact, they are the fourth most common injury among children under age six. Falls cause most of the fractures in this age group, but the most serious bone breaks usually result from car crashes.\nA broken bone in a child is different from one in an adult, because young bones are more flexible and have a thicker covering, which makes them better able to absorb shock. Children’s fractures rarely require surgical repair. They usually just need to be kept free of movement, most often through the use of a molded cast.\n\nTypes of Fractures\nMost  youngsters, broken bones are either “greenstick�? fractures, in which the bone bends like green wood and breaks only on one side, or “torus�? fractures, in which the bone is buckled, twisted, and weakened but not completely broken. A “bend�? fracture refers to a bone that is bent but not broken, and is also relatively common among youngsters. “Complete�? fractures, in which the bone breaks all the way through, also occur in young children.\nBecause your child’s bones are still growing, he is vulnerable to an additional type of fracture that does not occur in adults. This involves damage to the growth plates at the ends of the bones, which regulate future growth. If this part of the bone does not heal properly after the fracture, the bone may grow at an angle or more slowly than the other bones in the body. Unfortunately, the impact on the bone’s growth may not be visible for a year or more after the injury, so these fractures must be followed carefully by the pediatrician for twelve to eighteen months to make sure no growth damage has occurred.\nFractures that involve injury to the growth plate sometimes need surgery to minimize the risk of future growth problems. Fractures around the elbow often cause the arm to heal abnormally, resulting in a crooked position. Many require surgery to minimize this risk. Children with fractures near the elbow may be referred to an orthopedic specialist.\nFractures also are classified as “non-displaced,�? when the broken ends are still in proper position, or “displaced,�? when the ends are separated or out of alignment. In an “open�? or “compound�? fracture, the bone sticks through the skin. If the skin is intact, the fracture is “closed.�?\n\nSigns and Symptoms\nIt’s not always easy to tell when a bone is broken, especially if your child is too young to describe what he’s feeling. Ordinarily with a fracture, you will see swelling and your child will clearly be in pain and unable—or unwilling—to move the injured limb. However, just because your child can move the bone doesn’t necessarily rule out a fracture. Anytime you suspect a fracture, notify your pediatrician immediately.\nHome Treatment\nUntil your child can be seen in the pediatrician’s office, emergency room, or urgent care center, use an improvised sling or rolled-up newspaper or magazine as a splint to protect the injury from unnecessary movement.\nDon’t give the child anything by mouth to drink or to relieve pain without first consulting the doctor, but if yours is an older child, you can use an cold pack or a cold towel, placed on the injury site, to decrease pain. Extreme cold can cause injury to the delicate skin of babies and toddlers, so do not use ice with children this young.\nIf your child has broken his leg, do not try to move him yourself. Call 911 for an ambulance; let the paramedics supervise his transportation and make the child as comfortable as possible.\nIf part of the injury is open and bleeding, or if bone is protruding through the skin, place firm pressure on the wound; then cover it with clean (preferably sterile) gauze. Do not try to put the bone back underneath the skin. After this injury has been treated, be alert to any fever, which may indicate that the wound has become infected.\n\nProfessional Treatment\nAfter examining the break, the doctor will order X rays to determine the extent of the damage. If the doctor suspects that the bone’s growth plate is affected, or if the bones are out of line, an orthopedic consultation will be necessary.\nBecause children’s bones heal rapidly and well, a plaster or fiberglass cast, or sometimes just an immobilizing splint, is all that is needed for most minor fractures. For a displaced fracture, an orthopedic surgeon may have to realign the bones. This may be done as a “closed reduction,�? in which the surgeon uses local or general anesthesia, manipulates the bones until they’re straight, and then applies a cast. An “open reduction�? is a surgical procedure done in an operating room, but this is rarely necessary for children.\nAfter the surgical reduction, a cast will be used until the bone has healed, which usually takes about half the time that adult bones require, or less, depending on the child’s age. The nice thing about young bones is that they don’t have to be in perfect alignment. As long as they are more or less in the right place, they will remodel as they grow. Your pediatrician may order periodic X-rays while the bone is healing, just to make sure they are aligning properly.\nUsually casting brings rapid relief or at least a decrease in pain. If your child has an increase in pain, numbness, or pale or blue fingers or toes, call your doctor immediately. These are signs that the extremity has swollen and requires more room within the cast. If the cast is not adjusted, the swelling may press on nerves, muscles, and blood vessels, which can produce permanent damage. To relieve the pressure, the doctor may split the cast, open a window in it, or replace it with a larger one.\nAlso let the doctor know if the cast breaks or becomes very loose, or if the plaster gets wet and soggy. Without a proper, secure fit, the cast will not hold the broken bone in position to mend correctly.\nBones that have been broken often will form a hard knot at the site of the break during the healing process. Especially with a broken collarbone, this may look unsightly, but there is no treatment for this, and the knot will not be permanent. The bone will remodel and resume its normal shape in a few months.", "\nBroken Nose Treatment\n\n1. When to See a Health Care Provider\nGo to a hospital emergency room or see a health care provider immediately if\nYou cannot stop the nose from bleeding.\nThe nostril or nasal septum is crooked or out of place.\nThe person has clear drainage from one or both nostrils or a grapelike swelling inside the nose on the septum.\n\n2. Treat Symptoms\nApply ice for pain and swelling.\nHave the person rest and keep the head elevated even when sleeping.\nThe person should avoid blowing his or her nose.\nGive acetaminophen for pain. Do not give NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or aspirin.\n\n3. Follow UpIf the nose is not out of position, rest and home treatment may be all that's needed.\nIf the nose is crooked or it is difficult for the person to breathe through the nose, see a health care provider.\nIf you see a health care provider, the next steps depend on the particular case\nTo stop bleeding, the health care provider may pack the nostrils with gauze.\nFor a simple fracture, the health care provider may straighten the nose.\nSurgery may be needed to move bone or cartilage back in place for a more complicated fracture.\n\nBroken Nose Symptoms\nIt is usually obvious that there is an injury to the nose due to bruising, swelling, and bleeding from the nose. A history of traumatic injury should lead to suspicion of a broken bone in the nose or nasal fracture.\nSigns that suggest a person has a broken nose may include the following\nTenderness when touching the nose\nSwelling of the nose or face\nBruised nose\nBruising under the eyes (black eye)\nDeformity of the nose (crooked nose)\nNosebleed\nWhen touching the nose, a crunching or crackling sound (crepitus) or or creaking sensation like that of rubbing hair between 2 fingers\nPain and difficulty breathing out of the nostrils\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Care\nCall the doctor if any of the following occur\nThe pain or swelling does not go away in 3 days.\nThe nose looks crooked.\nBreathing through the nose is not possible after the swelling has gone down.\nA fever develops.\nRecurring nosebleeds develop.\nA significant injury that requires medical attention possibly exists.\nGo to a hospital's emergency department immediately if the following signs or symptoms are present\nBleeding for more than a few minutes from one or both of the nostrils\nBleeding from the nose does not stop\nClear fluid draining from the nose\nOther injuries to the face or the body\nOpen laceration to the nose or the face\nLoss of consciousness (fainting)\nSevere or unrelenting headaches\nRepeated vomiting\nDecrease or change in vision\nNeck pain\nNumbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms\nSignificant injury that may require immediate medical attention\n\nBroken Nose Self-Care at Home\n\nTaking the following actions at home may help reduce the symptoms of a broken nose.\nPlace ice wrapped in a cloth over the nose for about 15 minutes at a time and then remove the ice. This process can be repeated hourly throughout the day. Use ice at the time of injury and for 1-2 days afterward to reduce pain and swelling. Take breaks between applications, and do not apply the ice directly to the skin. A bag of frozen peas or corn can be used as an ice pack as it will conform to the nose.\nTake acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) to reduce pain. Only use these medications as directed.\nTake an over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant to aid in breathing through the nostrils.\nDo not use OTC nasal decongestants if the nose continues to bleed. Seek medical care.\nRead warning labels associated with these medications.\nThese medications should not be used for more than 3 days.\nElevate the head, especially when sleeping, to avoid increased swelling of the nose. Prop the head up with pillows or lift the head of the bed by placing large blocks or phone books under the mattress\n\nBroken Nose Prevention\nAvoid drug and alcohol use. Many nose breaks occur during or after abuse of these drugs.\nFollow safety rules when participating in sports and physical recreation.\nWear a seatbelt at all times while riding in a motor vehicle.\nMake sure children are in an approved car seat when riding in a vehicle.", "\nChemical Burn TreatmentCall Doctor if\n\n1. Protect Yourself\nPut on gloves or apron, if possible.\nAvoid exposing yourself to chemicals.\n\n2. Rinse and Clear Burn Area\nFlood area with cool water for at least 20 minutes or until help arrives.\nMake sure water doesn't flow onto another part of the person's body or onto you.\nDon't use a strong stream of water, if possible.\n\nAs you flush the burn (not before), remove jewelry or articles of clothing with chemical on them, unless they're stuck to the person's body.\nAfter flushing the burn, follow instructions on the label of the chemical product, if available.\nDon't try to neutralize the burn with acid or alkali. This could cause a chemical reaction that worsens the burn.\nDon't put antibiotic ointment on the burn.\n\n3. Cover a Small Burn Area\nYou can wrap a small burn with dry, sterile gauze or clean cloth.\n\nMore about Chemical Burns \nChemical burns can be caused by many substances, such as strong acids, drain cleaners (lye), paint thinner and gasoline. Usually, you are aware of the burn and its cause. But sometimes you may not immediately recognize a burn caused by a milder chemical. As with some sunburns, the pain and redness may develop hours after the exposure.\n\nif you have an immediately recognized chemical burn\n\nRemove the chemical causing the burn while protecting yourself. For dry chemicals, brush off any remaining material. Wear gloves or use a towel or other suitable object, such as a brush.\nRemove contaminated clothing or jewelry to prevent further burning.\nRinse the burn immediately. Run a gentle, steady stream of cool tap water over the burn for 10 or more minutes. A shower may be an effective way to do this. Always protect your eyes.\nLoosely apply a bandage or gauze.\nIf needed, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).\nConsider a tetanus shot. Make sure that your tetanus booster is up to date. Doctors recommend people get a tetanus shot at least every 10 years.\n\nIf you have a possible chemical burn\nMake sure that any contaminated clothing or jewelry is no longer in contact with your skin.\nRinse the burn if you think some of the chemical is still on your skin.\nLoosely apply a bandage or gauze.\nIf needed, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).\nConsider a tetanus shot. Make sure that your tetanus booster is up to date.\n\nWhen to seek emergency care\nThe person shows signs of shock, such as fainting, pale complexion or very shallow breathing.\nThe chemical burn penetrated through the first layer of skin and the burn covers an area more than 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) in diameter.\nThe chemical burn encircles a limb or involves the eyes, hands, feet, face, groin or buttocks, or a major joint.\n\nChemical Burn Symptoms\nAll chemical burns should be considered potential medical emergencies.\nMost chemical burns occur on the face, eyes, hands, arms, and legs. Usually a chemical burn will be relatively small and will require only outpatient treatment. Chemical burns can be deceiving, however. Some agents can cause deep tissue damage that is not not readily apparent when people first look at it.\nTissue damage from chemical burns depends on several factors.\nThe strength or concentration of the agent\nThe site of contact (eye, skin, mucous membrane)\nWhether swallowed or inhaled\nWhether or not skin is intact\nWith the quantity of the chemical\nThe duration of exposure\nHow the chemical works\nThe length of time to washing (decontamination)\n\nSigns and symptoms of chemical burns include the following\nRedness, irritation, or burning at the site of contact\nPain or numbness at the site of contact\nFormation of blisters or black dead skin at the contact site\nVision changes if the chemical gets into the eyes\nCough or shortness of breath\nVomiting\n\nIn severe cases, a person may develop any of the following symptoms\nLow blood pressure\nFaintness, weakness, dizziness\nShortness of breath or severe cough\nHeadache\nMuscle twitching or seizures\nCardiac arrest or irregular heartbeat\nChemical burns can be very unpredictable. Death from a chemical injury, although rare, can occur.\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Care\nOnce all immediate danger has passed and the person has completed basic first aid (removed from the chemical source, contaminated clothing removed, and, if skin or eyes involved, extensive rinsing with water in most situations), a doctor, if immediately available, should review the injury and the chemical involved to make sure the patient needs no further emergency treatment. If a potential problem remains, the doctor can arrange appropriate treatment or will direct the patient to go to a hospital's Emergency Department.\nAny chemical burn can be a legitimate reason to summon emergency medical help if no doctor is immediately available. Always err on the side of safety and call 911 if the severity of the injury is unknown, if the medical stability of the person injured is not clear, or if there are any concerns about a chemical injury.\nEmergency personnel are trained to assess the extent of a chemical burn, begin treatment, and transport victims to the most appropriate hospital.\n\nEmergency officials also may determine the need for more involved decontamination of both the patient and the accident site prior to going to the hospital. It is possible that the patient needs further decontamination before arriving at the hospital. As much of the following information as possible needs to be related to the 911 dispatcher\nnumber and location of the injured person or people\nMechanism or nature of injury (how it happened)\nWhether emergency personnel can reach the victims (are victims trapped?)\nName, strength, and volume or quantity of the chemical causing the burn (give a container or its label of the chemical to emergency personnel, if possible)\nLength of time of contact with the chemical", "\n\nChest Injury Treatment\nCall Doctor\nEmergency medical assistance is critical for any serious wound to the chest.\nEven if there are no external wounds, there may be internal damage.\n1. Begin CPR, if Necessary\nIf the person’s breathing has stopped or seems dangerously weak\nFor a child, start CPR for children.\nFor an adult, start adult CPR.\n\n2. Cover an Open Wound\nUse a cloth, pad, piece of clothing, plastic, aluminum, or whatever is at hand.\nIf possible, cover two inches beyond the edge of the wound.\nIf blood bubbles up from the wound or you hear air passing through the chest cavity, tape cover down on three sides to prevent air from building up in the chest.\nDo not remove any objects that have penetrated the chest.\n\n3.

The first thing you may think of is heart attack. Certainly chest pain is not something to ignore. But you should know that it has many possible causes. In fact, as much as a quarter of the U.S. population experiences chest pain that is not related to the heart. Chest pain may also be caused by problems in your lungs, esophagus, muscles, ribs, or nerves, for example. Some of these conditions are serious and life threatening. Others are not. If you have unexplained chest pain, the only way to confirm its cause is to have a doctor evaluate you.\nYou may feel chest pain anywhere from your neck to your upper abdomen. Depending on its cause, chest pain may be\nSharp\nDull\nBurning\nAching\nStabbing\nA tight, squeezing, or crushing sensation\n\nHere are some of the more common causes of chest pain.\nChest Pain Causes: Heart Problems\nAlthough not the only cause of chest pain, these heart problems are common causes\nCoronary Artery Disease, or CAD. A blockage in the heart blood vessels that reduces blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle itself. This can cause pain known as angina. It's a symptom of heart disease but typically does not cause permanent damage to the heart. It is, though, a sign that you are a candidate for a heart attack at some point in the future. The chest pain may spread to your arm, shoulder, jaw, or back. It may feel like a pressure or squeezing sensation. Angina can be triggered by exercise, excitement, or emotional distress and is relieved by rest.\n\nMyocardial infarction (heart attack) \nThis reduction in blood flow through heart blood vessels causes the death of heart muscle cells. Though similar to angina chest pain, a heart attack is usually a more severe, crushing pain usually in the center or left side of the chest and is not relieved by rest. Sweating, nausea, shortness of breath, or severe weakness may accompany the pain.\n\nMyocarditis. \nIn addition to chest pain, this heart muscle inflammation may cause fever, fatigue, fast heart beat, and trouble breathing. Although no blockage exists, myocarditis symptoms can resemble those of a heart attack.Chest Pain Causes: Bone, Muscle, or Nerve Problems\nSometimes chest pain may result from overuse or an injury to the chest area from a fall or accident. Viruses can also cause pain in the chest area. Other causes of chest pain include\n\nRib problems.\n Pain from a rib fracture may worsen with deep breathing or coughing. It is often confined to one area and may feel sore when you press on it. The area where the ribs join the breastbone may also become inflamed.\n\nMuscle strain. Even really hard coughing can injure or inflame the muscles and tendons between the ribs and cause chest pain. The pain tends to persist and it worsens with activity.\nShingles.\n Caused by the varicella zoster virus, shingles may prompt a sharp, band-like pain before a telltale rash appears several days later.\n\nOther Potential Causes of Chest Pain\nAnother potential cause of chest pain is anxiety and panic attacks. Some associated symptoms can include dizziness, sensation of shortness of breath, palpitations, tingling sensations, and trembling.\n\nWhen to See the Doctor for Chest Pain\nWhen in doubt, call your doctor about any chest pain you have, especially if it comes on suddenly or is not relieved by anti-inflammatory medications or other self-care steps, such as changing your diet.\n\nCall Doctor if you have any of these symptoms along with chest pain\nA sudden feeling of pressure, squeezing, tightness, or crushing under your breastbone\nChest pain that spreads to your jaw, left arm, or back\nSudden sharp chest pain with shortness of breath, especially after a long period of inactivity\nNausea, dizziness, rapid heart rate or rapid breathing, confusion, ashen color, or excessive sweating\nVery low blood pressure or very low heart rate\n\nCall your doctor if you have any of these symptoms\nFever, chills, or coughing up yellow-green mucus\nProblems swallowing\nSevere chest pain that does not go away", "\nTreating Colds in ChildrenCall doctor if  \nYour child has difficulty breathing.\nThere's no way to cure your child's cold, but you can help relieve the symptoms that make your baby or toddler uncomfortable.\nYour child has a cold and is 3 months or younger.\nYour child has a severe cough.\nYour child has ear pain.\nSymptoms don't get better after 10 to 14 days.\n1.

Replace Fluids\nFor mild dehydration or while waiting for medical care for an adult with severe dehydration that is not due to heat stroke\nThe person should try to drink 2 quarts of fluid, such as water, juice, or sports drinks (clear fluids, best), in 2 to 4 hours. But it is better to drink small amounts of fluid often (sips every few minutes), because drinking too much fluid at once can induce vomiting.\nThe person should drink at least 10 glasses of liquid a day to replace lost fluids.\nIf the person is elderly, fluid replacement may need to be done slowly. Consult a doctor.\nIf the person is vomiting, try ice chips, popsicles, and small sips of fluid.\nIf the person is recovering from diarrhea, consider that some sports drinks contain a lot of sugar, which can worsen diarrhea.\n\n2. When to Call a Doctor for Mild Dehydration\nSeek medical help if\nThe person’s symptoms get worse or don't improve within 24 hours.\nThe person is elderly.\nYou think a prescription medication such as a diuretic caused the dehydration.\n\n3. Follow Up\nFor mild dehydration, the person should rest for 24 hours and keep drinking fluids, even if symptoms improve. Fluid replacement may take up to a day and a half.\nIf dehydration is moderate to severe, fluids may need to be replaced intravenously (IV) in the hospital.\n\nCauses of Dehydration \nMany conditions may cause rapid and continued fluid losses and lead to dehydration\nFever, heat exposure, and too much exercise\nVomiting, diarrhea, and increased urination due to infection\nDiseases such as diabetes\nThe inability to seek appropriate water and food (as in the case of a disabled person)\nAn impaired ability to drink (for instance, someone in a coma or on a respirator)\nNo access to safe drinking water\nSignificant injuries to skin, such as burns or mouth sores, or severe skin diseases or infections (water is lost through the damaged skin)\n\nSymptoms of Dehydration in Adults\nThe signs and symptoms of dehydration range from minor to severe and include\nIncreased thirst\nDry mouth and swollen tongue\nWeakness\nDizziness\nPalpitations (feeling that the heart is jumping or pounding)\nConfusion\nSluggishness fainting\nFainting\nInability to sweat\nDecreased urine output\nUrine color may indicate dehydration. If urine is concentrated and deeply yellow or amber, you may be dehydrated.\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Care\nCall your doctor if the dehydrated person experiences any of the following\nIncreased or constant vomiting for more than a day\nFever over 101°F\nDiarrhea for more than 2 days\nWeight loss \nDecreased urine production\nConfusion\nWeakness\n\nTake the person to the hospital's emergency department if these situations occur\nFever higher than 103°F\nConfusion\nSluggishness (lethargy)\nHeadache \nSeizures \nDifficulty breathing\nChest or abdominal pains\nFainting\nNo urine in the last 12 hours\n\nDehydration Treatment - Self-Care at Home\nTry to get people who are dehydrated (even those who have been vomiting) to take in fluids in the following ways\nSipping small amounts of water\nDrinking carbohydrate/electrolyte-containing drinks. Good choices are sports drinks such as Gatorade or prepared replacement solutions (Pedialyte is one example)\nSucking on popsicles made from juices and sports drinks\nSucking on ice chips\nSipping through a straw (works well for someone who has had jaw surgery or mouth sores)\nTry to cool the person, if there has been heat exposure or if the person has an elevated temperature, in the following ways\nRemove any excess clothing and loosen other clothing.\nAir-conditioned areas are best for helping return body temperatures to normal and break the heat exposure cycle.\nIf air conditioning is not available, increase cooling by evaporation by placing the person near fans or in the shade, if outside. Place a wet towel around the person.\nIf available, use a spray bottle or misters to spray lukewarm water on exposed skin surfaces to help with cooling by evaporation.\nAvoid exposing skin to excessive cold, such as ice packs or ice water. This can cause the blood vessels in the skin to constrict and will decrease rather than increase heat loss. Exposure to excessive cold can also cause shivering, which will increase body temperature --the opposite effect you're trying to achieve.\n\nPrevention\nThe foremost treatment for dehydration is prevention. Anticipate the need for increased fluid intake.\nPlan ahead and take extra water to all outdoor events and work where increased sweating, activity, and heat stress will increase fluid losses. Encourage athletes and outdoor workers to replace fluids at a rate that equals the loss.\nAvoid exercise and exposure during high heat index days. Listen to weather forecasts for high heat stress days, and plan events that must occur outside during times when temperatures are cooler.\nEnsure that older people and infants and children have adequate drinking water or fluids available and assist them as necessary. Make sure that any incapacitated or impaired person is encouraged to drink and provided with adequate fluids.\nAvoid alcohol consumption, especially when it is very warm, because alcohol increases water loss and impairs your ability to sense early signs associated with dehydration.\nWear light-colored and loose-fitting clothing if you must be outdoors when it is hot outside. Carry a personal fan or mister to cool yourself.\nBreak up your exposure to hot temperatures. Find air-conditioned or shady areas and allow yourself to cool between exposures. Taking someone into a cooled area for even a couple of hours each day will help prevent the cumulative effects of high heat exposure.", "\n\nDiaper Rash Treatment\nDiaper rash is very common, especially in babies who have started to eat solid foods. Here are ways you can help your child.\nCall Doctor If\nThe rash seems severe (crusty, oozing, spreading).\nThe rash appears along with other symptoms, such as a fever or diarrhea.\nThe rash happens while the child is taking antibiotics.\nThe child seems to be very irritable or in pain because of the rash.\n1. Change Diapers Often\nChange your baby's diaper as soon as it's wet or soiled.\nUse warm water and gentle soap -- or skip the soap entirely.\nAvoid fragranced wipes or wipes all together.\n\n2. Let the Area Dry\nAfter a change or bath, pat the diaper area dry. Don't rub.\nWhen possible, put your baby down on a cloth without a diaper and let the skin air dry.\nNever put on a new diaper until your baby's skin is completely dry.\n\n3. Soothe the Skin\nProtect the skin with a thick layer of petroleum jelly or zinc oxide cream. This creates a barrier between skin and moisture.\n\n4. Avoid Irritants\nAvoid baby wipes that are scented or contain alcohol.\nIf you use cloth diapers, don't wash them with a scented detergent.\nDon't use rubber or plastic pants over the diaper, since they trap moisture and heat.\nMake sure your baby's diapers aren't too tight.What causes diaper rash?\n\nMost diaper rashes are caused by skin irritation. Irritation can be caused by diapers that rub against the skin or fit too tightly. Irritation can also occur if your baby is left in a wet or dirty diaper for a long period of time. Your baby's skin can also be irritated by the soap used to wash cloth diapers, or by some brands of disposable diapers or baby wipes.\nPlastic pants that fit over diapers raise the temperature and moisture in the diaper area. Heat and moisture make it easier for diaper rash to start and for germs to grow.\nDiaper rash can also develop while the baby is on antibiotics (or if the mother is on antibiotics while breastfeeding).\n\nHow can I prevent and treat diaper rashes?\nThe key to preventing and treating diaper rash is to keep your baby's diaper area clean, cool and dry.\nChange your baby's diaper often, and let him or her go without a diaper when possible to let the air dry his or her skin.\nTry placing your baby on an open cloth diaper during nap time. Check the diaper shortly after your baby falls asleep and replace it if it's wet. Babies often urinate right after falling asleep.\nDon't use creams that contain boric acid, camphor, phenol, methyl salicylate or compound of benzoin tincture. These things can be harmful.\n\nTips on preventing and treating diaper rash\nCheck your baby's diaper often and change it as soon as it's wet or soiled.\nCarefully clean your baby's bottom between diaper changes. Use plain warm (not hot) water with or without a very mild soap.\nAllow your baby's skin to dry completely before putting on another diaper.\nAvoid baby wipes and soaps that are scented. The alcohol or fragrance can make skin irritation worse.\nUse products that contain zinc oxide ointment (such as Desitin Ointment) or petroleum (such as Vaseline) to protect your baby's skin from moisture.\nAvoid using plastic pants or diapers with plastic edges.\nAfter bathing, pat your baby's bottom dry with a towel rather than scrubbing it. Scrubbing can irritate your baby's sensitive skin.\nIf diaper rash persists, change the type of wipes, diapers or soap you're using.\nIf these things don't work, talk to your doctor.\n\nWhat about powder?\nDoctors don’t recommend using talcum powder or cornstarch. Talcum powder can get in your baby's lungs. Cornstarch may make a diaper rash caused by a yeast infection worse.\n\nPrevention\nShould I use cloth or disposable diapers?\nThe choice is up to you. Some research suggests that because disposable diapers are more absorbent they keep babies drier.\nIf you use cloth diapers and wash them at home, boil them for 15 minutes on the stove after washing them to kill germs and remove soap that could irritate your baby's skin.\nBut remember that the most important thing about diapers is to change them often.", "\n\nDiving Ear Pain Treatment\n\nSymptoms of diving ear pain (also known as barotrauma) includeEar pressure\nMild to severe ear pain\nNausea\nReduced hearing\nRinging ear\nVertigo\nVomiting\n\n1. Stop the Descent\nHelp the person ascend until symptoms disappear. Do not go up faster than is safe.\nIf ear still hurts as the person goes up or if there are other symptoms, end the dive.\n\n2. Treat Symptoms\nFor pain, give ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Avoid ibuprofen and other NSAIDs if the person has heart failure or kidney failure.\n\n3. When to See a Health Care Provider\nSeek immediate medical care if\nPain, a feeling like there is water in the ears, or muffled hearing continues after the dive is over\nThere are symptoms of inner ear damage, such as deafness, ear ringing, or vertigo\nThe person has experienced ear pain when diving before\nIf possible, see an ear, nose, and throat specialist with experience in treating diving-related ear problems.\n\n4. Follow Up\nTo avoid serious hearing loss or other problems, the person should not go on another dive until the pain goes away or the person sees a doctor.\n\nSigns and symptoms common in children include\nEar pain, especially when lying down\nTugging or pulling at an ear\nDifficulty sleeping\nCrying more than usual\nActing more irritable than usual\nDifficulty hearing or responding to sounds\nLoss of balance\nFever of 100 F (38 C) or higher\nDrainage of fluid from the ear\nHeadache\nLoss of appetite\n\nCommon signs and symptoms in adults include\nEar pain\nDrainage of fluid from the ear\nDiminished hearing\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nSigns and symptoms of an ear infection can indicate a number of conditions. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. Call your child's doctor if\nSymptoms last for more than a day\nEar pain is severe\nYour infant or toddler is sleepless or irritable after a cold or other upper respiratory infection\nYou observe a discharge of fluid, pus or bloody discharge from the ear\nAn adult with ear pain or discharge should see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nComplications\nMost ear infections don't cause long-term complications. Frequent or persistent infections and persistent fluid buildup can result in some serious complications\nImpaired hearing. Mild hearing loss that comes and goes is fairly common with an ear infection, but it usually returns to what it was before the infection after the infection clears. Persistent infection or persistent fluids in the middle ear may result in more significant hearing loss. If there is some permanent damage to the eardrum or other middle ear structures, permanent hearing loss may occur.\nSpeech or developmental delays. If hearing is temporarily or permanently impaired in infants and toddlers, they may experience delays in speech, social and developmental skills.\nSpread of infection. Untreated infections or infections that don't respond well to treatment can spread to nearby tissues. Infection of the mastoid, the bony protrusion behind the ear, is called mastoiditis. This infection can result in damage to the bone and the formation of pus-filled cysts. Rarely, serious middle ear infections spread to other tissues in the skull, including the brain.\nTearing of the eardrum. Most eardrum tears heal within 72 hours. In some cases, surgical repair is needed.\n\nTreatments and drugs\nMost ear infections resolve without treatment with antibiotics. What's best for your child depends on many factors, including your child's age and the severity of symptoms.\n\nA wait-and-see approach\nSymptoms of ear infections usually improve within the first couple of days, and most infections clear up on their own within one to two weeks without any treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend a wait-and-see approach as one option for\nChildren 6 to 23 months with mild inner ear pain in one ear for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F (39 C)\nChildren 24 months and older with mild inner ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than102.2 F (39 C)\nSome evidence suggests that treatment with antibiotics might be beneficial for certain children with ear infections. Talk to your doctor about the benefits of antibiotics weighed against the potential side effects and concern about overuse of antibiotics creating strains of resistant disease.\n\nManaging pain\nYour doctor will advise you on treatments to lessen pain from an ear infection. These may include the following\nA warm compress. Placing a warm, moist washcloth over the affected ear may lessen pain.\nPain medication. Your doctor may advise the use of over-the-counter acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil, others) to relieve pain. Use the drugs as directed on the label. Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Because aspirin has been linked with Reye's syndrome, use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Although aspirin is approved for use in children older than age 2, children and teenagers recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.\n\nAntibiotic therapy\nYour doctor may recommend antibiotic treatment for an ear infection in the following situations\nChildren 6 months and older with moderate to severe ear pain in one or both ears for at least 48 hours or a temperature of 102.2 F (39 C) or higher\nChildren 6 to 23 months with mild inner ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F (39 C)\nChildren 24 months and older with mild inner ear pain in one or both ears for less than 48 hours and a temperature less than 102.2 F (39 C)\nEven after symptoms have improved, be sure to use all of the antibiotic as directed. Failing to do so can result in recurring infection and resistance of bacteria to antibiotic medications. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about what to do if you accidentally skip a dose.", " \n\nCall Doctor if the person has\nCollapsed\nStopped breathing\n\n1.

This is called exercise-induced asthma.\nPeople who have exercise-induced asthma may be more sensitive to changes in air temperature and humidity.\nAnyone who exercises hard enough in cool, dry air may experience bouts of coughing, and everyone can get breathless during vigorous exercise. However, this usually passes once you stop exercising...\n\nCould it be exercise-induced asthma?\nIf you notice symptoms like breathlessness that persist or worsen 5–10 minutes after you stop exercising, and which improve over the next 30 minutes, you may have exercise-induced asthma.\nA doctor may prescribe an inhaled corticosteroid (preventer medicine) for 8–12 weeks to reduce the severity of exercise-induced asthma. Around 50% of people no longer experience symptoms after having this treatment.\nIf necessary, you can also use some extra asthma medication (typically a reliever medicine) before you begin exercise to help prevent symptoms.\n\nAsthma symptoms are caused by inflamed, narrowed and sensitive airways. They can be brought on or made worse by particular triggers, such as dust mites or pollen.\nSymptoms can vary from person to person and from time to time, and sometimes you may not have any symptoms at all.\nThe most common asthma symptoms are\nshortness of breath\nwheezing — a high-pitched raspy sound when breathing\ntightness in the chest\npersistent cough, particularly at night, early morning, or with exercise or activity.\nYou may have all these symptoms, or only a wheeze or a cough.

There can be bleeding in the space around your brain, which is a subarachnoid hemorrhage, or bleeding within your brain tissue, which is an intracerebral hemorrhage.\nSubarachnoid bleeds often cause headaches and vomiting. The severity of intracerebral hemorrhages depends on how much bleeding there is, but over time any amount of blood can cause pressure to build.\n\nConcussion\nA concussion is a brain injury that occurs when your brain bounces against the hard walls of your skull. Generally speaking, the loss of function associated with concussions is temporary. However, repeated concussions can eventually lead to permanent damage.\n\nEdema\nAny brain injury can lead to edema, or swelling. Many injuries cause swelling of the surrounding tissues, but it’s more serious when it occurs in your brain. Your skull can’t stretch to accommodate the swelling, which leads to a buildup of pressure in your brain. This can cause your brain to press against your skull.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of a Head Injury?\nYour head has more blood vessels than any other part of your body, so bleeding on the surface of your brain or within your brain is a serious concern in head injuries. However, not all head injuries cause bleeding. It’s important to be aware of other symptoms to watch out for. Many symptoms of serious brain injury won’t appear right away. You should always continue to monitor your symptoms for several days after you injure your head.\n\nCommon symptoms of a minor head injury include\nheadache\nlightheadedness\na spinning sensation\nmild confusionnnausea\ntemporary ringing in the ears\n\nThe symptoms of a severe head injury include many of the symptoms of minor head injuries.

See your doctor right away if you think you have the symptoms of a serious head injury.\nIn particular, you should always call 911 or go to an emergency room if you experience loss of consciousness, confusion, or disorientation. Even if you don’t go to the ER immediately after the accident, you should seek help if you still have symptoms after a day or two.\nIn the case of a potentially serious head injury, you should always call 911. Motion can sometimes make a head injury worse, and emergency medical personnel are trained to move patients carefully without causing more damage.", "\nCall Doctor and Ambulance\n\n1.

Follow UpAt the hospital, an emergency department doctor will examine the person and run tests to see if chest pain stems from a heart attack or another cause. Tests may include an electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and blood tests.\n\nWhat are symptoms of a heart attack?\nKnowing the early warning signs of heart attack is critical for prompt recognition and treatment. Many heart attacks start slowly, unlike the dramatic portrayal often seen in the movies. A person experiencing a heart attack may not even be sure of what is happening. Heart attack symptoms vary among individuals, and even a person who has had a previous heart attack may have different symptoms in a subsequent heart attack. Although chest pain or pressure is the most common symptom of a heart attack, heart attack victims may experience a diversity of symptoms. The following list describes the symptoms of heart attack in more detail.\n\n1. Chest discomfort, manifest as pain, fullness, and/or squeezing sensation of the chest\nChest pain is the hallmark symptom of a heart attack, although it can take many different forms. In other cases, chest pain may not occur at all. The characteristic chest pain of a heart attack has been described as a sense of pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain that starts in the center of the chest. The pain or discomfort typically lasts more than a few minutes, or it may go away and then return. It can spread down the arms, to the back, or to the head and neck. Both women and men report chest pain as a primary symptom of heart attack, but women more often than men are likely to have some of the other symptoms, such as nausea, jaw pain, or shortness of breath, that are described below\n\n2. Jaw pain, toothache, headache\nThe pain of a heart attack can spread down both arms, to the jaw or head, or to the back. Some people report tooth pain or headache as a symptom of a heart attack. It is possible to have these types of pain without chest pain during a heart attack.\n\n3. Shortness of breath\nFeeling short of breath or like you are gasping for air is a common symptom of a heart attack. Shortness or breath, or difficulty breathing, is medically known as dyspnea. Shortness of breath may occur before or during the chest pain of a heart attack, and in some cases, it may be associated with other heart attack symptoms without any chest pain.\n\n4. Nausea\nNausea or feeling sick on your stomach is a less common but possible symptom of heart attack. Sometimes belching or burping can accompany the nausea, and some patients have described a feeling like indigestion associated with a heart attack. Women are more likely than men to report these less typical symptoms of heart attack, and some patients have described feeling as though they are developing the flu\n\n5. Vomiting\nThe nausea that accompanies a heat attack can become so severe that vomiting occurs.\n\n6. General epigastric (upper middle abdomen) discomfort\nSometimes the pain of heart attack is described as stomach pain, or pain in the middle of the upper abdomen. The pain usually feels more like discomfort of heaviness srather than sharp, stabbing pain, and the pain tends to persist more than a few minutes. This can occur with or without pain in the true chest area.\n\n7. Sweating\nSweating, or perspiration, can accompany a heart attack. Some people have described feeling like they are breaking out in a cold sweat.\n\n8. Heartburn and/or indigestion\nAs mentioned above, some people experiencing a heart attack can have belching and burping and describe a feeling of indigestion. Likewise, the pain and pressure of a heart attack may occur in the epigastric or upper middle abdominal area, similar to the pain of heartburn.\n\n9. Arm pain (more commonly the left arm, but may be either arm)\nThe chest pain of a heart attack can spread, or radiate, down one or both arms and to the shoulders. This often happens, and the pain may even extend to the wrist and fingers. This is most common on the left side of the body but it can also occur on the right side.\n\n10. Upper back pain\nThe upper back is another common location for spread of the pain from a heart attack. Most commonly, back pain that stems from a heart attack is described as occurring between the shoulder blades.\n\n11. General malaise (vague feeling of illness)\n\nWomen's symptoms sometimes differ\nAlthough most women and men report symptoms of chest pain with a heart attack, women are slightly more likely than men to report unusual symptoms. Those who have more vague or less typical “heart�? symptoms have reported the following\nUpper back or shoulder pain\nJaw pain or pain spreading to the jaw\nPressure or pain in the center of the chest\nLight headedness\nPain that spreads to the arm\nUnusual fatigue for several days\nIn a multi-center study of 515 women who had an acute myocardial infarction (MI), the most frequently reported symptoms were unusual fatigue, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath, indigestion and anxiety. The majority of women (78%) reported at least one symptom for more than one month before their heart attack.", "\n\nHeat rash in young children can look uncomfortable, but it's usually not serious.\n\nCall Doctor If\nThe heat rash is still visible after 3 or 4 days.\nThe rash gets worse.\nThe rash causes serious itching.\nThe rash oozes pus or swells.\nThe rash is red or tender.\n\n1.

Keep Your Child Hydrated\nMake sure your child is getting enough fluids when the weather is hot.\n\nSymptomsWhere is heat rash most likely to appear?\nHeat rash is most likely to appear in places where skin touches skin, such as the following\nNeck\nGroin\nUnderneath the breasts\nIn the creases of the elbows\nArmpits\n\nWhat causes heat rash?\nHeat rash is most common in newborns and infants, but it can also affect adults. It is usually triggered by sweating too much, having a high body temperature, being overdressed or being in a very warm environment. Babies who are bundled in too much clothing and people who are not used to hot weather are most likely to get heat rash.\n\nHow can I treat heat rash?\nThe most effective treatment for heat rash is to keep your skin cool and dry.\nCool down. Avoid hot and humid places. If possible, stay in air-conditioned areas, or use fans to circulate the air. Use cool compresses to bring down the temperature of the affected skin.\nDry off. Keep the irritated skin dry. Use a fan to dry the skin off faster and to reduce sweating.\nReduce friction. Wear loose clothes to prevent irritation caused by clothing that rubs against the skin.\nTreat fever. If you have a fever, treat it with an over-the-counter drug, like acetaminophen (brand name: Tylenol) or ibuprofen (some brand names: Advil, Motrin), according to the directions on the package.\nIf your rash is severe, your doctor may prescribe a lotion to help relieve your pain or discomfort.\n\nWhen should I go to the doctor?\nIn most cases, heat rash goes away on its own. If your heat rash doesn’t go away after 3 or 4 days, or if it seems to be getting worse, talk to your doctor. In some cases, heat rash may be caused by an infection. See your doctor if your itchiness is severe or if the rash area swells or oozes pus. If you feel dizzy, nauseous, or confused, or you have trouble breathing, go to the emergency room right away. These symptoms can be signs of serious heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion or heatstroke.\n\nHow can I prevent heat rash?\nIn hot weather, dress yourself or your baby in lightweight cotton clothing. Cotton helps absorb moisture to keep it off of your skin.\nIf the weather is hot, turn on the air conditioner, or use a fan to help you stay cool and dry.\nAvoid using baby powders and creams. They can block your pores and actually make your skin warmer.", "Knee Injury First Aid Treatment\nCall doctor if\nThe knee or leg bones look deformed.\nThe person can't bear weight on the leg.\nThe pain is extreme.\nThere is immediate swelling, tingling, or numbness below the knee.\n\n1. Control Swelling\nUse the RICE method\nRest the knee.\nIce the area.\nCompress with a wrap or elastic sleeve.\nElevate the knee as much as possible.\n\n2. Treat Symptoms\nFor pain, give over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.\n\n3. When to Call a Doctor\nMake an appointment with a doctor if you still have pain after two weeks of home treatment, if the knee becomes warm, or if you have fever along with a painful, swollen knee.\n\n4. Follow Up\nIf you seek medical help, the doctor will examine the knee and may do X-rays or other methods of imaging. Medical treatments may include anti-inflammatory drugs, draining fluid, physical therapy, crutches or braces, or surgery.\n\nknee injury symptoms and signs?\n\nThe symptoms and signs of knee injury are related to the type of injury and the part of the knee that was injured.\nThe main symptoms of knee injury are as follows\nPain\nSwelling\nHeat\nRedness\nTenderness\nDifficulty bending the knee\nProblems weight bearing\nClicking or popping sounds\nLocking of the knee\nFeeling of instability\nBruising\n\nIf the injury is acute, the main symptoms will most likely be pain and swelling. If the injury is chronic or from overuse, the symptoms of clicking, popping, and intermittent pain will be more prominent.\n\ntreatment for a knee injury?\nTreatment for a knee injury depends on the part of the knee that is damaged and the extent of the damage.\nSome injuries such as simple strains or sprains are treated with RICE therapy (rest, ice, compression, and elevation). Taking time off from sports and exercise may be enough for minor injuries to heal. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) may help treat the pain and inflammation from these minor injuries.\nKnee immobilization or splinting keeps the knee from moving and decreases the chance of further injury. It can help stabilize an injured knee that may not be stable due to torn ligaments. It also keeps the knee from moving to assist in resting the knee.\nChronic knee injuries involving inflammation and bursitis may be treated with anti-inflammatories. Injections of cortisone (a steroid with powerful anti-inflammatory effects) may be helpful in these situations.\nMore extensive injuries involving torn ligaments, instability of the knee joint, swelling, decreased range of motion, or fractures will require an orthopedic surgeon consultation. In the initial stages of these more extensive injuries, RICE therapy can still be used. Staying off the leg by using crutches or a wheelchair may be advised.\nSurgery may be indicated for tears of the ligaments or extensive damage to the menisci. Surgery may also be needed for fractures or dislocations of the knee. Some acute injuries such as those with high-force impact, or multiple parts of the knee damaged, may require emergency surgery.\nMost knee surgery can be done arthroscopically, a procedure in which a camera is used and small punctures are made in the knee to insert instruments. Repairs can be done inside the knee without having the open the knee with a large incision. Most arthroscopic surgeries do not need to be done immediately after an acute injury. Some are delayed to allow for decreased inflammation.\n\nAfter surgery, or if surgery is not an option, physical therapy can be used to strengthen and stretch the muscles surrounding the knee. Physical therapy can also allow for better movement mechanics of the leg and the knee to help prevent future injury.", "Rape/Sexual Assault Treatment Frist Aid\nCall Doctor if the victim\n\nHas sustained a serious injury\nIs unconscious\n\n1.

Follow up\nA doctor will treat injuries from the rape or sexual assault.\nVictims should be treated for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and should also ask the doctor about emergency birth control. It is important to receive birth control and treatment for STDs within 72 hours of the assault for maximum effectiveness.\n\nSymptoms and signs of someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped\nSigns and symptoms of someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped tend to include depression, guilt, anger, and anxiety. Behaviorally, the victim of sexual violence might become aggressive, abuse substances, or break rules, like not attending work or school. The victim might also have sleeping or eating problems, withdraw from relationships, and have sexual problems.\n\nPrevention of sexual assault and rape\nSome ways to prevent sexual assault and rape are to lessen the life risk factors for being the victim or perpetrator of these crimes. While risk factors like being less than 15 years old and being in a married or cohabitating relationship are not amenable to change, refraining from the use of drugs or alcohol and decreasing the number of sexual partners may help decrease the vulnerability to sexual victimization. That perpetrators of rape or other sexual assault are often drunk or intoxicated with another substance at the time of the assault indicates that such offenses are frequently drug facilitated. While increased female empowerment sometimes places women at increased risk for spousal sexual violence, helping women improve their socioeconomic status out of poverty or to achieve careers outside of sex work (for example, in prostitution, adult entertainment, or what many interpret to be other forms of sexual exploitation) may decrease their risk for rape or other forms of sexual assault.\n\nFactors that tend to decrease the likelihood that men will engage in committing a rape include individual factors like refraining from the use of drugs or alcohol, exercising good impulse control, and having good perceptions of women; family factors like having a supportive family and absence of domestic violence; and community factors like low crime rates in general and having strong laws and policies about sexual violence.

Get Emergency Help If the Person\nIs unconscious\nIs dizzy or confused\nHas chest pain or tightness\nIs coughing or choking violently\nHas wheezing, shortness of breath, or irregular breathing\nHas ash or smoke around mouth and nose\nHas burns inside mouth, throat, and nose\nas swollen airways\nHas black or gray saliva\nIs nauseated or vomiting\nIs hoarse\nHas double or blurry vision\nHas numbness or tingling in his or her extremities\nIf the person is alert, ask if he or she has a lung disease such as COPD or asthma, and check to see if the person's acute inhaler is nearby for the person to self administer.\n\n2. Get the Person to Safety\nMove the person into fresh air if you can do so safely.\nSit or lay the person down, but not on back if the person is vomiting or coughing up sputum.\n\n3. Give CPR\nWhile waiting for help, if the person is not breathing, give CPR\nFor a child, start CPR for children\nFor an adult, start adult CPR.\n\nIf the person has pale and clammy skin, glazed eyes, sweating, rapid and shallow breathing, weakness, dizziness, or vomiting\n\n4. Go to a Hospital Emergency Room\nThe person should be examined immediately, even if there are no symptoms.\nDamage from toxin inhalation may not show up for hours and can worsen quickly.\n\n5. Follow Up\nAt the hospital, the next steps depend on the particular case.\nA doctor will examine the person's airways for damage, do tests, and may administer oxygen.\nThe person may be hospitalized.\nAn antibiotic, bronchodilator, inhaled cortisone, or other medication may be prescribed.\n\nApproach Considerations\n\nBeware that patients may appear asymptomatic on arrival but may develop significant signs and symptoms as long as 36 hours after exposure, especially in fires, which produce small particles with low water solubility. Be aware of pertinent historical risk factors when treating patients with potential smoke inhalation injury. These include closed-space fires, carbonaceous sputum, elevated carbon monoxide (CO) levels, and central facial burns.\nAcute respiratory distress usually responds very well to aggressive initial management. Normal laboratory values and imaging studies, coupled with clinical improvement, can give the health care provider a false sense of security. The patient then may be discharged, only to deteriorate as delayed pulmonary edema ensues. Any patient with significant exposure to toxic smokes should be observed for 24-48 hours and imaged with serial chest radiographs. Difficulty arises in defining a significant exposure, since the clinical response is so varied.\nProvide intravenous (IV) access, cardiac monitoring, and supplemental oxygen in the setting of hypoxia. A small subset of patients manifests bronchospasm and may benefit from the use of bronchodilators, although this is not well documented. This is especially true of patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma.\n\nTreatment of inhalation injuries caused from toxic smokes is based on clinical presentation and involves primarily supportive care directed at the cardiopulmonary system. In some cases (eg, cyanide [CN] poisoning, methemoglobinemia), specific antidotes are available. Subcutaneous epinephrine has been used in zinc oxide (HC) exposures.\nCorticosteroids are attractive for suppressing inflammation and reducing edema, but no direct data support their use in smoke inhalation. Because of the increased risk of pulmonary infection and delayed wound healing, prolonged use of steroids is discouraged. However, consider a brief course of steroids in those patients with otherwise unresponsive severe lower airway obstruction. In addition, patients receiving steroids prior to injury who may experience adrenal insufficiency should receive stress doses of steroids.\n\nAlthough controlled studies assessing the effects of steroids on various forms of chemical pneumonitis are disappointing, steroids have been suggested as having some value in exposure to the following\nOxides of nitrogen (NOx)\nZinc oxide (HC)\nRed phosphorus (RP)\nSulfur trioxide (FS)\nTitanium tetrachloride (FM)\nPolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE; Teflon)In a case series by Huang et al, 25% of patients presented after HC exposure with acute lung injury requiring ventilatory support. All of these patients survived with glucocorticoids, antibiotics and lung-protective ventilatory management. However, there was no control group, so a causal link could not be made between survival and steroid treatment\n\nSmoke inhalation injuries predispose the airways to infection because of cellular injury, reduction of mucociliary clearance, and poor macrophage function. Acute bacterial colonization and invasion peaks at 2-3 days after smoke inhalation. Prophylactic antibiotics should not be used, as they are not only ineffective but increase the risk of emergence of resistant organisms.\nDiscerning secondary infection from the effects of inhalation injury can be very difficult because both may produce fever, elevated white blood cell counts, and abnormal radiography findings. Antimicrobial therapy should be reserved for patients with definitive microbiologic evidence of infection that is not responding to aggressive support therapy or when clinical deterioration occurs in the first 72 hours.\n\nThe most common organisms in secondary pneumonia after smoke inhalation injury are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Direct parenteral coverage with antibiotics to cover these bacteria if infection is suspected.", "Snakebite First Aid Treatment\nCall Doctor if\n\nThere is any chance that the snake is venomous\nThe person has difficulty breathing\nThere is loss of consciousness\nIf you know the snake is not venomous, treat as a puncture wound.\n\n1.

Signs and symptoms of a snakebite may include the following\nTwo puncture marks at the wound\nRedness or swelling around the wound\nSevere pain\nNausea\nVomiting\nDifficulty breathing\nFever-like symptoms, such as sweating\nNumbness or tingling sensation in the fingers, toes or area around the wound\nBlurry vision\nDiarrhea\nFainting\nConvulsions\n\nWhat should I do if I get a snakebite?\nA bite from a poisonous snake is a medical emergency. If you or someone else gets bitten by a snake, get help immediately.Rapid pulse\n\nWhat to do if you get bitten by a snake\nRemain calm and call for help.\nIf you are alone, try to get to the nearest hospital as soon as you can.\nRestrict movement as much as possible and try to keep the wound just below the level of your heart. This will reduce the spread of venom.\nTake off any jewelry or tight clothing near the bite before swelling starts.\nTry to remember what the snake looked like: its color, shape and markings. This will help with your treatment.\nCover the bite with a clean, dry bandage.\n\nWhat NOT to do if you get bitten by a snake:Never apply ice to the snakebite or soak the wound in water.\nNever cut the place that has been bitten.\nNever try to suck the venom out of the snakebite.\nNever apply a tourniquet or try to stop blood flow to or from the snakebite.\nNever try to pick up or trap the snake.\nDo not drink alcohol to relieve the pain of a snakebite.\nDo not drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee or soda after you’ve been bitten by a snake.", "Teething Pain Treatment \nCall Doctor If\n\nYour child has a fever of 101° F or higher, has diarrhea, is dehydrated, or seems especially cranky; these are not typical symptoms of teething.\n\n1. Offer Something to Chew on\nUse a firm rubber teether.\nAvoid teethers filled with liquid, which can leak, or freezable teethers, which may be too cold or hard.\nNever tie a teether around a baby's neck -- it's a choking hazard.\n\n2. Soothe the Gums\nGently massage the gums with a cool wet washcloth or a clean finger.\nIf your child is eating solid foods, offer cold applesauce or yogurt.\n\n3. Use Medication if a Pediatrician Recommends It\nUse baby acetaminophen (Tylenol) to dull pain. Do not use ibuprophen unless the baby is at least 6 months old.\nDo not use topical pain relievers applied to the gums. They could cause dangerous side effects.\n\n4. Prevent Rash\nKeep a cloth with you to wipe away drool from baby's chin.\n\nTeething: 4 to 7 Months\nTeething usually starts during these months. The two front teeth (central incisors), either upper or lower, usually appear first, followed by the opposite front teeth. The first molars come in next, followed by the canines or eyeteeth.\nThere is great variability in the timing of teething. If your child doesn’t show any teeth until later than this age period, don’t worry. The timing may be determined by heredity, and it doesn’t mean that anything is wrong.\n\nTeething occasionally may cause mild irritability, crying, a low-grade temperature (but not over 101 degrees Fahrenheit or 38.3 degrees Celsius), excessive drooling, and a desire to chew on something hard. More often, the gums around the new teeth will swell and be tender. To ease your baby’s discomfort, try gently rubbing or massaging the gums with one of your fingers. Teething rings are helpful, too, but they should be made of firm rubber. (The teethers that you freeze tend to get too hard and can cause more harm than good.) Pain relievers and medications that you rub on the gums are not necessary or useful since they wash out of the baby’s mouth within minutes. Some medication you rub on your child’s gums can even be harmful if too much is used and the child swallows an excessive amount. If your child seems particularly miserable or has a fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius), it’s probably not because she’s teething, and you should consult your pediatrician.\n\nHow should you clean the new teeth? Simply brush them with a soft child’s toothbrush when you first start seeing her teeth. To prevent cavities, never let your baby fall asleep with a bottle, either at nap time or at night. By avoiding this situation, you’ll keep milk from pooling around the teeth and creating a breeding ground for decay.\n\nWhat Are Teething Symptoms and Signs?\nMany children have little or no problem with teething, while others may have significant discomfort. Usually, the pain with teething comes and goes and may seem to ease after several minutes. Teething symptoms are not well defined, and parents as well as care providers often attribute symptoms to teething, which may not be accurate. Some of the symptoms of teething can be attributed to the dental follicle (sac containing the developing tooth) and the release of inflammatory agents during the tooth eruption.\nTeething may cause the following symptoms and signs\nIncreased drooling\nRestlessness or decreased sleeping due to gum discomfort\nRefusal of food due to soreness of the gum region\nFussiness that comes and goes\nBringing the hands to the mouth\nMild rash around the mouth due to skin irritation secondary to excessive drooling\nRubbing the cheek or ear region as a consequence of referred pain during eruption of the molarsTeething has not been shown to cause the following\nHigh fever (especially over 101 degrees)\nDiarrhea, runny nose, and cough\nProlonged fussiness\nRashes on the body\n\nWhen Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Teething?\nBecause teething is so common and other symptoms such as fever, fussiness, colds, and diarrhea are also common, both conditions may often occur at the same time. Teething may not be causing these symptoms. Other illnesses or disorders (for example, viral infections) are much more likely to be causing fever, fussiness, nasal congestion with cough, and diarrhea. It is important to contact a doctor if these or other symptoms seem concerning. Do not assume that they are just from the teething.\nTeething should not require emergency care. If there is concern that something other than teething may be causing symptoms, contact a health-care professional.\n\nAre There Any Home Remedies for Teething?\nOften, the infant's gums feel better when gentle pressure is placed on the gums. For this reason, many doctors recommend gently rubbing the gums with a clean finger or having the child bite down on a clean washcloth.\nIf the pain seems to be causing feeding problems, sometimes a different-shaped nipple or use of a cup may reduce discomfort and improve feeding.\nCold objects may help reduce the inflammation, as well. Using teething rings can be helpful. Veteran parents have discovered the usefulness of refrigerated wet washcloths, cold pacifiers, spoons, frozen bagels, or frozen bananas. Be careful to avoid having prolonged contact of very cold objects on the gums. Also, never put anything into a child's mouth that might cause the child to choke.\nUse of pain medications: Some controversy surrounds the use of pain medicines for teething.\nWhile some parents endorse topical medications, studies have not consistently shown their benefit. In May 2011, the FDA issued a warning urging avoidance of oral medications containing a topical anesthetic called benzocaine. Benzocaine is the primary ingredient found in many over-the-counter teething gels, lozenges, and sprays. The FDA warning points out an association with a rare but extremely serious complication called methemoglobinemia. This side effect substantially limits the ability of red blood cells to transport oxygen throughout the body. This development may produce a side effect spectrum from serious to lethal. Individuals who develop methemoglobinemia will become pale, short of breath, confused, and lightheaded. A rapid heart rate is also common. Such an adverse reaction may develop upon first exposure or after several exposures to benzocaine. Any individual who displays such symptoms after exposure to benzocaine should seek immediate medical attention at the closest emergency department. A medication can be used to reverse these side effects.\nMedicines that are taken by mouth to help reduce pain: Acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Children's Advil or Motrin) may also help with pain. Ask a health-care professional for advice regarding the use of these and other medications. Caution should be taken not to overmedicate for teething. The medicine may mask significant symptoms that could be important to know about. Do not give children products containing aspirin.\nHomeopathic remedies and other home remedies are used widely, but there is limited research into their true effectiveness. These include the use of clove oil, licorice sticks, fennel, green onion, olive oil, ginger root, and chamomile.", "Call Doctor if the person is not pregnant and have abnormal vaginal bleeding with\n\nLight-headedness\nFainting\nSkin that appears unusually pale\n\n1. See a Health Care Provider\nCall for an appointment with a health care provider. While many causes are minor, others can be serious.\n\n2. Monitor Symptoms\nKeep track of your menstrual cycle to report symptoms to a doctor. On a calendar, take note of the dates and length and amount of bleeding (light, medium, heavy, or spotting).\n\n3. Follow Up\nThe health care provider will ask about your menstrual cycle and health history and do an exam to find the cause of bleeding.\nThe health care provider may also order blood tests, transvaginal ultrasound, or endometrial biopsy.\nUterine fibroids, hormonal imbalances, medications, polycystic ovary syndrome, gynecological cancers, and sexually transmitted infections are some causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding.\n\nWhat is a normal menstrual cycle?\nThe menstrual cycle begins with the first day of bleeding of one period and ends with the first day of the next. In most women, this cycle lasts about 28 days. Cycles that are shorter or longer by up to 7 days are normal.\n\nAt what ages is abnormal uterine bleeding more common?\nAbnormal uterine bleeding can occur at any age. However, at certain times in a woman’s life it is common for periods to be somewhat irregular. They may not occur on schedule in the first few years after a girl has her first period (around age 9–16 years). Cycle length may change as a woman nears menopause (around age 50 years). It also is normal to skip periods or for bleeding to get lighter or heavier at this time.\n\nWhat causes abnormal uterine bleeding?\nAbnormal uterine bleeding can have many causes. They include the following\nPregnancy\nMiscarriage\nEctopic pregnancy\nAdenomyosis\nUse of some birth control methods, such as an intrauterine device (IUD) or birth control pills\nInfection of the uterus or cervix\nFibroids\nProblems with blood clotting\nPolyps\nEndometrial hyperplasia\nCertain types of cancer, such as cancer of the uterus, cervix, or vagina\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\n\nWhat medications are used to help control abnormal uterine bleeding?\nHormonal medications often are used to control abnormal uterine bleeding. The type of hormone you take will depend on whether you want to get pregnant as well as your age. Birth control pills can help make your periods more regular. Hormones also can be given as an injection, as a vaginal cream, or through an IUD that releases hormones. An IUD is a birth control device that is inserted in the uterus. The hormones in the IUD are released slowly and may control abnormal bleeding.\n\nOther medications given for abnormal uterine bleeding include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), tranexamic acid, and antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can control bleeding and reduce menstrual cramps. Tranexamic acid is a drug used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. Infections are treated with antibiotics.", "\n\n1. Get Immediate Help, if Necessary\nIf there is obvious deformity, severe pain, numbness, or the person cannot move the wrist or maintain a grip, see a doctor Immediately or go to a hospital emergency department. These are signs of a possible fracture.\nSupport the hurt arm and wrist with a makeshift splint, such as a ruler, stick, rolled up newspaper, a pillow or sling, until you get help\n\n2. Rest Wrist\nMinimize wrist motion to prevent further injury.\n\n3. Control Swelling\nIce the area for 20 minutes at a time, 4 to 8 times the first day.\nYou may apply a compression wrap such as an Ace bandage.\nElevate the wrist above heart level.\n\n4. Treat Symptoms\nFor pain and inflammation, give the person over-the-counter pain medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Do not give aspirin to anyone under age 18 unless advised by your doctor for a specific condition.\n\n5. Follow-Up\nIf pain and swelling get worse in 24 hours, see a doctor.\nThe doctor may need to order X-rays to rule out a fracture that was not obvious and examine the wrist to look for signs of tendonitis, arthritis, gout, infection, or other conditions.\n\nYour wrist is made up of eight small bones known as carpals. They support a tube that runs through your wrist. That tube, called the carpal tunnel, has tendons and a nerve inside. It is covered by a ligament, which holds it in place.\nWrist pain is common. Repetitive motion can damage your wrist. Everyday activities like typing, racquet sports or sewing can cause pain, or even carpal tunnel syndrome. Wrist pain with bruising and swelling can be a sign of injury. The signs of a possible fracture include misshapen joints and inability to move your wrist. Some wrist fractures are a result of osteoporosis.\nOther common causes of pain are\nSprains and strains\nTendinitis\nArthritis\nGout and pseudogout\n\nWrist Injury Symptoms\nThe amount of pain or the ability to move the wrist does not reliably determine whether the wrist is broken or sprained. Signs and symptoms of wrist injury include the following\nSwelling\nHeat/warmth\nPain\nDiscoloration\nLimited ability to move the joint\nDeformity\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Care\nIf you have severe pain, deformity, numbness, or are unable to move your wrist, you should call your doctor for an immediate appointment, go to an urgent care clinic, or go to a hospital's emergency department.\nIf there is no deformity and the pain is manageable with over-the-counter pain medication, you may want to wait 12-24 hours before deciding whether to call the doctor. If symptoms persist after a day, see a doctor\nIf you have obvious deformity, numbness, or severe pain, you need medical attention.\n\nIf there is obvious deformity or severe swelling, there may be a broken bone that needs to be moved back into its normal position.\nThere also can be a dislocation where the bones are no longer in the correct position, although they are not broken.\n\nWrist Injury Treatment\nWhen you have fallen and injured your wrist, it is important to rest your arm.\nIf there is an obvious deformity of the wrist or numbness in the hand, you should lay your wrist across a soft pillow and seek medical attention immediately.\nIf there is no obvious deformity and you are not in severe pain, you may want to take some acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) and wait to see how the wrist feels. Again, a soft pillow is a good temporary splint.\nApply ice to the area. Do not put ice directly on your skin. You can wrap a bag of frozen vegetables in a towel to create an icepack.\nIf pain or other symptoms do not go away within a day, you should see a doctor.\n\nMedical Treatment\nIf there is no fracture seen on the X-ray, the doctor may diagnose a sprain. In cases where there is tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox, the doctor may also suspect there may be a fracture of the scaphoid that is not apparent on the X-rays.\nFor a wrist sprain, the doctor may decide to treat you with no splint, a Velcro wrist splint, or plaster splint (like a cast). The decision about a splint will be based on your level of pain, amount of swelling, restriction of movement, and concern about an occult or hidden fracture. (An occult fracture is a fracture that is so small that it does not appear on the initial X-rays.) If the doctor has concerns about an occult fracture, the doctor may splint you and advise you to have repeat X-rays at your doctor's office or with an orthopedist (bone specialist) in 5-10 days.\nFor minor sprains, you will likely not be given a splint and told to limit activity appropriate to your level of pain.\nFor more severe sprains, you will likely be given a Velcro wrist splint that you can take on and off. Also you might be prescribed some form of pain medication. You should make sure that you let the doctor know what other medications you are taking and any allergies that you have.\nMost experts recommend only the use of ice or cold therapy for sprains. Some doctors may still recommend switching to heat therapy after 24-48 hours.\nTreatment of a fracture (a broken bone) depends on the specific type of fracture found. If you have a fracture, you may be treated by the doctor who sees you initially or you may be referred to an orthopedic surgeon.", "\nCall Doctor if the person has:\nA severe reaction\nA seizure\nA loss of consciousness\nFor a severe reaction\n\nWhile waiting for emergency help, inject glucagon if you are trained to do so.\nFor moderate to mild symptoms\n1.

Repeat Treatment, if Necessary\nAfter 15 minutes, test blood sugar, if possible.\nIf symptoms persist or blood sugar reading is below 70 mg/dL, give another high-sugar food.\nIf the person's next meal is more than 30 minutes away, give the person a small snack, such as 1/2 sandwich, 1 oz. cheese with 4 to 6 crackers, or 1 tablespoon peanut butter with 4 to 6 crackers.\n\n3. When to Get Medical Help Immediately\nIf the person still doesn't feel better, go to a hospital emergency room or call Doctor.\n\n4. Follow Up\nIf you go to the hospital, doctors may give sugar intravenously.\n\nSymptoms of Low Blood Sugar?\nSymptoms of low blood sugar can occur suddenly. They include\nblurry vision\nrapid heartbeat\nsudden mood changes\nsudden nervousness\nunexplained fatigue\npale skin\nheadache\nhunger\nshaking\nsweating\ndifficulty sleeping\nskin tingling\ntrouble thinking clearly or concentrating\nloss of consciousness\nIf you have hypoglycemic unawareness, a condition in which you do not know your blood sugar level is dropping, your blood sugar can drop so quickly you may not even have warning symptoms. When this occurs, you can faint, experience a seizure, or even go into a coma.\nVery low blood sugar is a medical emergency. If you know that someone is diabetic and he or she is experiencing these symptoms, help him or her to eat 15 grams of quickly digesting carbohydrate, such as\na half cup of juice or regular soda\n1 tablespoon of honey\n4 or 5 saltine crackers\n3 or 4 pieces of hard candy or glucose tablets\n1 tablespoon of sugar\n\nSerious Complications from Spells of Low Blood Sugar\nMildly low blood sugar levels are somewhat common for people with diabetes\n however, severely low blood sugar levels can be life-threatening. They may lead to seizures and nervous system damage. Immediate treatment is critical. It is important to learn to recognize your symptoms and treat them fast. For people at risk of low blood sugar, having a glucagon kit, a medication that raises blood sugar levels, is important. Talk to your healthcare provider for more information.\nYou may also want to talk with friends, family members, and coworkers about how to care for you if your blood sugar drops too low. They should learn to recognize low blood sugar symptoms and know how to use the glucagon kit, as well as understand the importance of calling Doctor if you lose consciousness.\nWearing a medical identification bracelet is a good idea. It can help emergency responders care for you properly if you need emergency attention.\nTreat low blood sugar as soon as possible. Avoid driving if you are experiencing low blood sugar, as it can increase your risk of accident...\n\nWhat Causes Low Blood Sugar?\nLow blood sugar can occur for a number of reasons. It is usually a side effect of diabetes treatment.\n\nDiabetes and Low Blood Sugar\nDiabetes affects your body’s ability to use insulin. Think of insulin as the key that unlocks your cells, letting glucose in for energy. People with diabetes use a variety of treatments to help their bodies use the glucose in their blood. One very important treatment is insulin injections.\nIf you inject too much insulin, your blood sugar may drop too low. People also sometimes inject insulin when planning to eat a big meal, but then they do not eat enough.\nExcess physical activity without eating enough can also cause a drop in blood sugar levels.\n\nOther Causes of Low Blood Sugar\nYou don’t have to have diabetes to experience low blood sugar. Some other causes of low blood sugar include\ncertain medications, such as quinine\ndrinking too much alcohol\nsome medical conditions, such as hepatitis or kidney disorders\na tumor that produces excess insulin\nendocrine disorders, such as adrenal gland deficiency\n\nHow Can Episodes of Low Blood Sugar Be Prevented?\nRegularly checking your blood sugar level can help you keep it in your target range. Talk to your doctor about when and how often you should check your blood sugar.\nIf you have had low blood sugar episodes in the past, you may wish to check your blood sugar levels before driving (or operating other types of machinery). Consider having a snack before you leave your home or if your blood sugar levels are less than 100 mg/dL.", "Call doctor for immediate help if the person or child \nIs very dehydrated\nHas severe abdominal pain\n\nTreating Dehydration\n\n 1. Take Fluids\nAsk your doctor what fluids are best for you or your child. Here are some basic tips \nGive an adult plenty of clear fluid, like fruit juices, soda, sports drinks and clear broth. Avoid milk or milk-based products, alcohol, apple juice, and caffeine while you have diarrhea and for 3 to 5 days after you get better. They may make diarrhea worse.\nGive a child or infant frequent sips of a rehydration solution such as Pedialyte, CeraLyte, or Infalyte. Do not add salt tablets to a baby’s bottle.\nMake sure the person drinks more fluids than they are losing through diarrhea. If they are unable to keep up with their losses, call a doctor.\n\n 2. Rest\nHave the person rest as needed and avoid strenuous exercise. Keep a sick child home from school or day care.\n\n 3. Ease Into Eating\nFeed an infant or child easily digested foods; the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) is a good choice as soon as they can tolerate food.\n\n 4.

The actual cause of most individual episodes of food poisoning, however, never is pursued (for example, a culture is not done) since most episodes are mild or moderate in severity and are over in a few hours to a few days. In fact, the diagnosis of food poisoning usually is made only presumptively, based on the individual's symptoms and the circumstances. Even in outbreaks of suspected food poisoning that involve many people, when careful studies are done, a specific cause is found no more than half of the time\n\nViral infections \ncause most cases of diarrhea and are typically associated with mild-to-moderate symptoms with frequent, watery bowel movements, abdominal cramps, and a low-grade fever. Viral diarrhea generally lasts approximately 3 to 7 days.\n\nThe following are the common causes of diarrhea caused by viral infections\nRotavirus is a common cause of diarrhea in infants.\nNorovirus (for example, Norwalk virus, caliciviruses) is the most common cause of epidemics of diarrhea among adults and school-age children (for example, cruise ship infection, schools, nursing homes, day care facilities, and restaurants).\nAdenovirus infections are common in all age groups", "1.

Call a Health Care Provider\nSee a health care provider immediately if\nNosebleed doesn't stop after 10 minutes of home treatment.\nThere is so much bleeding that it is hard to breathe.\nThe person is taking blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), fondaparinux sodium (Arixtra), or aspirin, or has a bleeding disorder.\nNosebleed happens after a severe head injury or a blow to the face.\n\n 3. Medical TreatmentThe health care provider may use specialized cotton material, insert a balloon in the nose, or use a special electrical tool to cauterize the blood vessels.\n\n 4. Follow Up\nBroken noses often are not fixed immediately. The health care provider will refer the person to a specialist for a consultation once the swelling goes down.\nThe person should avoid strenuous activity; bending over; and blowing, rubbing, or picking the nose until it heals.\nThe nostrils should be kept moist with a water-based lubricant or by increasing the humidity in the home.\n\nMore about Nosebleed\nNosebleeds (epistaxis, nose bleed) can be dramatic and frightening. Fortunately, most nosebleeds are not serious and usually can be managed at home, although sometimes medical intervention may be necessary.\nNosebleeds are categorized based on where they originate, and are described as either anterior (originating from the front of the nose) or posterior (originating from the back of the nose).\nAnterior nosebleeds make up most nosebleeds. The bleeding usually originates from a blood vessel on the nasal septum, where a network of vessels converge (Kiesselbach plexus). Anterior nosebleeds are usually easy to control, either by measures that can be performed at home or by a health care practitioner.\nPosterior nosebleeds are much less common than anterior nosebleeds. They tend to occur more often in elderly people. The bleeding usually originates from an artery in the back part of the nose. These nosebleeds are more complicated and usually require admission to the hospital and management by an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat specialist).\nNosebleeds tend to occur more often during winter months and in dry, cold climates. They can occur at any age, but are most common in children aged 2 to 10 years and adults aged 50 to 80 years. For unknown reasons, nosebleeds most commonly occur in the morning hours. \n\nNosebleed CausesMost nosebleeds do not have an easily identifiable cause. However, trauma to the nose is a very common cause of nosebleeds. Nosebleeds can be caused by trauma to the outside of the nose from a blow to the face, or trauma to the inside of the nose from nose picking. Other conditions that predispose a person to nosebleeds include\nExposure to warm, dry air for prolonged periods of time\nNasal and sinus infections\nNallergic rhinitis\nNasal foreign body (object stuck in the nose)\nNigorous nose blowing\nNasal surgery\nDeviated or perforated nasal septum and cocaine use\n\nLess commonly, an underlying disease process or taking certain medications may cause a nosebleed or make it more difficult to control.\nInability of the blood to clot is most often due to blood-thinning medications such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or aspirin.\nTopical nasal medications, such as corticosteroids and antihistamines, may sometimes lead to nosebleeds.\nLiver disease, chronic alcohol abuse, kidney disease, platelet disorders, and inherited blood clotting disorders can also interfere with blood clotting and predispose to nosebleeds.\nVascular malformations in the nose and nasal tumors are rare causes of nosebleeds.\nHigh blood pressure may contribute to bleeding, but is rarely the sole reason for a nosebleed. It is often the anxiety associated with the nosebleed that leads to the elevation in blood pressure", "Call doctor immedialty if\nThe person has been seriously wounded.\nBleeding can't be stopped after 10 minutes of firm and steady pressure.\nBleeding is severe.\nBlood spurts from the wound.\n\n1.

He or she will also check for signs of infection.\nClean the wound with a special solution and remove any damaged tissue.\nMay use stitches to close a bite wound, but often the wound is left open to heal, which can lower the risk of infection.\nMay prescribe an antibiotic to prevent infection.\nMay give you a tetanus shot if you had your last shot more than 5 years ago.\nMay ask you to schedule an office visit to check your wound again in 1 to 2 days.\nIf your injury is severe, or if the infection has not gotten better even though you're taking antibiotics, your doctor may suggest that you see a specialist and/or go to the hospital, where you can get special medicine given intravenously (through an IV needle into your vein) and further treatment if necessary.\n\n Call your doctor in any of these situations\nYou have a cat bite. Cat bites often cause infection. You don't need to call your doctor for a cat scratch, unless you think the wound is infected.\nYou have a dog bite on your hand, foot or head, or you have a bite that is deep or gaping.\nYou have diabetes, liver or lung disease, cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or another condition that could weaken your ability to fight infection.\nYou have any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, warmth, increased tenderness, oozing of pus from the wound or a fever.\nYou have bleeding that doesn't stop after 15 minutes of pressure or you think you may have a broken bone, nerve damage or another serious injury.\nYour last tetanus shot (vaccine) was more than 5 years ago. (If so, you may need a booster shot.)\nYou were bitten by a wild animal or a domestic animal (such as a pet) of unknown vaccination status.\n\nWill I need a rabies shot?\nProbably not. Rabies is uncommon in dogs and cats in the United States. (It is more common in wild animals like skunks, raccoons, bats and coyotes.) If a dog or cat that bit you appeared to be healthy at the time of the bite, it's unlikely that the animal had rabies. However, it's a good idea to take some precautions if you're bitten by a dog or cat.\nIf you know the owner of the dog or cat that bit you, ask for the pet's vaccination record (record of shots). An animal that appears healthy and has been vaccinated may still be quarantined (kept away from people and other animals) for 10 days to make sure it doesn't start showing signs of rabies. If the animal gets sick during the 10-day period, a veterinarian will test it for rabies. If the animal does have rabies, you will need to get a series of rabies shots (see below).\nIf the animal is a stray or you can't find the owner of the dog or cat that bit you, call the animal control agency or health department in your area. They will try to find the animal so it can be tested for rabies.\nIf the animal control agency or health department can't find the animal that bit you, if the animal shows signs of rabies after the bite or if a test shows that the animal has rabies, your doctor will probably want you to get a series of rabies shots (also called post-exposure prophylaxis). You need to get 2 shots as soon as possible after the bite occurs. After this, your doctor will give you 3 more shots over a 14-day period.\nHow can I prevent cat and dog bites?\nHere are some things you can do to prevent bites\nNever leave a young child alone with a pet. They often don't know how to be gentle with the pet, which can cause the pet to get irritated and bite.\nDo not try to separate fighting animals. You may get bit in the process.\nAvoid sick animals and/or animals that you don't know whether or not they are vaccinated.\nLeave animals alone while they are eating.

The feeling of dizziness, or a dizzy spell, may be familiar to an individual, yet difficult to describe. The person may have a feeling of lightheadedness, spinning, whirling, or motion, either of themselves or of the surroundings. The person may also feel as if they are going to faint. Dizziness may be just mildly annoying or caused by something possibly life-threatening. Some of the reasons a person might feel the sensation of dizziness include:\nFainting or near fainting, which may result from\nEmotional upset\nStanding up too quickly (orthostatic hypotension) or standing still too long\nHaving the flu, a cold, or other illness\nSeasickness or motion sickness\nFatigue or tiredness\nVertigo, which is similar to, but not the same condition as dizziness, is a medical term to describe a spinning sensation of a person's surroundings, usually caused by head movement or positioning. This is the same feeling an individual might have after getting off a merry-go-round or spinning in place. Several diseases of the balance organs of the inner ear can cause vertigo, or it may be a symptom of a tumor or stroke.\n\n causes of dizziness\nDizziness may be attributed to a wide variety of causes. Sometimes doctors find no specific diagnosis for the affected individual, but some causes of dizziness are dangerous. Some causes of dizziness include\n\nDizziness caused by heart diseases or blood pressure problemsHeart attack, arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythms), heart rate too fast or slow\nWeakened, aged, or diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), toxins or drugs that affect the rate or force of the contractions of the heart\nExtremely high blood pressure\nLow blood pressure, which can have multiple causes including diseases of the heart, bleeding disorders that cause anemia, and adverse reactions to medications\nDizziness caused by brain diseases or conditions\nStroke, tumor, headaches, migraines\nLoss or decrease of blood supply to the brain, such as fainting (syncope or vasovagal syncope)\nDementia or confusion\nDizziness caused by medications\nAlmost all medications list dizziness as a possible side effect, but it is more common with some types of medicines\nBlood pressure medications, diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers, antidepressants, pain relievers, and some antibiotics\n\nDizziness caused by metabolic disorders\nHypoxia (low blood oxygen)\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia including an insulin reaction\nDehydration\n\nDizziness caused by aging\nReduced capacity for exercise or activity, weakness, and deconditioning\nReduced ability for the blood circulation to compensate for quickly assuming an upright position (orthostatic hypotension)\nHardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis)\nNeuropathy (a progressive dysfunction of the nerves that is caused by different illnesses, especially diabetes)\nMenopause\nPoor eyesight and coordination\nDementia\n\nDizziness caused by psychiatric conditions\nDepression, anxiety, or panic disorder\nHyperventilation is from breathing too fast or too deeply, usually from anxiety or metabolic disorders\nSomatization is the conversion of a mental illness, such as anxiety or depression, into physical symptoms.

They occur in the course of normal activities of the day or as a result of sudden use of a muscle with activity. Activities that can increase the risk of muscle strain include athletic activity in sports, with sudden acceleration or deceleration, throwing, quick and/or heavy lifting, sudden coughing, or injury of muscle while performing irregular work tasks. It is possible to strain any muscle that moves bones. Commonly strained muscles include the lumbar muscles, hamstring muscles of the posterior thigh, abdominal muscles, biceps muscles, triceps muscles, adductor muscles, quadriceps muscles of the thigh, triceps muscles, calf muscles, upper back muscles including trapezius and rhomboid muscles, neck muscles, and the intercostal muscles and oblique muscles of the chest.\nMuscle Strain Symptoms and Signs\nSwelling, bruising or redness, or open cuts as a consequence of the injury\nPain in the muscles at rest\nPain when the specific muscle or the joint in relation to that muscle is used\nWeakness sensation of the associated muscle or tendons (A sprain, in contrast, is an injury to a joint and its ligaments.)\nInability to use the affected muscle at all \n\nWhen to Seek Medical Care for a Muscle Strain\nIf one has a significant muscle injury (or if the home care methods bring no relief in 24 hours), call a doctor.\nIf someone hears a popping sound with the injury, cannot walk, or there is significant swelling, pain, fever, or open cuts, he or she should be examined in a hospital's emergency department.", "Call doctor for immediate help if the person or child \n\nTrouble breathing\nFeelings of faintness or dizziness\nHives\nA swollen tongue\nA history of severe allergy reaction to insect stings\nInject epinephrine if the person is unable to.

Also keep track of symptoms such as rectal or abdominal pain, rectal pressure, constipation, diarrhea, cramping, fever, or mucus and pus in the stools.3\n\n. Follow Up\nThe health care provider may do a rectal exam and order tests, such as a colonoscopy, to find the cause. Rectal bleeding may stem from many conditions, including hemorrhoids, anal fissures, anal abscesses or fistulas, diverticulosis, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcers, polyps, or colon cancer.\nRectal bleeding is typically caused by hemorrhoids varicose veins in and around the rectum. Hemorrhoids are relatively common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester and in the weeks after giving birth. If you strain during a bowel movement, pass hard stools, or rub when you wipe, these swollen veins may bleed.\nAnal fissures are another cause of rectal bleeding. These painful cracks in the skin of the anus may be caused by passing hard stools as a result of constipation, which is common during pregnancy.�?\n\n�?If you have rectal pain or bleeding, check with your doctor. The odds are overwhelming that you have a fissure or a crack in your rectum that can be cured with antibiotics and a topical nitroglycerin cream. If your doctor does not find hemorrhoids or fissures, you must have a tube inserted into your colon to check for other causes of bleeding such as cancers, since one in four cases of rectal bleeding not caused by fissures or hemorrhoids is caused by serious disease (2). If you have a small crack called a fissure or large veins called hemorrhoids, you can often be cured by applying a special ointment made by mixing one part of the commercially available (by prescription) 2% nitroglycerin ointment with 20 parts of Vaseline (3,4,5,7,8,10). If you do not dilute the nitroglycerine, it can cause headaches. I also recommend that both you and your mate take a long-acting erythromycin (azithromycin 250 mg once a day for 9 days).�?\nAnorectal disorders: These are the most common causes of minor rectal bleeding.\nHemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids are swollen rectal veins in the anal and rectal area. They can cause burning, painful discomfort, and bleeding.\nExternal hemorrhoids are small swellings that are easy to see and quite painful. Anal itching is common.\nInternal hemorrhoids are usually painless. A rectal mass sensation may be noted with bowel movements.�?\n\nWhy Do Men Have Rectal Bleeding After Lifting Heavy Weights\nMen who notice rectal bleeding after lifting heavy weights might feel alarmed and concerned for their health. Most of the time, rectal bleeding results from a minor health condition, although bleeding that persists, worsens or is accompanied by other digestive problems requires medical evaluation. Fortunately, most cases of rectal bleeding are preventable through lifestyle changes and treatable with medical and home care.\n\nDigestive Disorders\nMen who have certain disorders of the digestive system might experience rectal bleeding after lifting heavy weights. Men with Crohn's disease, chronic diarrhea, stomach ulcers, rectal ulcers or colitis might notice a small amount of blood after using the bathroom or lifting weights. Rectal bleeding after weightlifting might also result from infections of the digestive system.\n\nHemorrhoids\nExertion during physical activities such as weight lifting can cause or worsen hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding. Certain lifting techniques such as squatting while lifting or holding poses while lifting weights might also contribute to the development of hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding in men. Spending long periods of time standing while lifting weights might also cause hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding to develop.\n\nInjuries\nWhen lifting heavy weights, injuries such as tears in the skin or tissue around the anus, a condition referred to as anal fissure, might cause rectal bleeding. Wiping with abrasive toilet paper can irritate an anal fissure and cause rectal bleeding when lifting weights. Men who wear underwear or workout clothes made of rough fabric might experience rectal bleeding after lifting weights, as a result of irritated skin. Injuries from anal sex might also cause rectal bleeding in men.\n\nMedications and Supplements\nWeightlifting men who utilize certain dietary supplements might experience rectal bleeding. Iron supplements, diuretics and laxatives might cause men to experience constipation that results in rectal bleeding. Antacids containing aluminum and calcium can also cause constipation that results in rectal bleeding. Medications including narcotic pain relievers, calcium channel blockers, anticonvulsants and antidepressants might also cause men to develop rectal bleeding.\n\nUnbalanced Diet\nMen who lift weights and eat a diet rich in fatty foods such as whole dairy products, eggs and meat might experience constipation which can lead to rectal bleeding after passing a bowel movement. In addition, diets that are low in fiber can also cause rectal bleeding due to constipation. Dehydration, which might occur during strenuous exercise such as lifting heavy weights, is another cause of constipation and the rectal bleeding which can follow. In addition, men who travel extensively might experience changes in bowel patterns that can lead to rectal bleeding.", "1. Get Help\n\nCall your health care provider to set up a prompt appointment, even if you only see blood once in the urine. Inform the staff about the blood when you call.\nSymptoms may include blood clots or red, pink, orange, or brown color in urine.\n\n2. Monitor Symptoms\nBe ready to answer these questions for the health care provider\nWhat color was the blood in the urine?\nWere there blood clots? If so, what size and shape?\nWas there blood at the beginning or end of the urine stream or during the entire stream?\nWas it painful for to urinate? Where was the pain located (for example, back, side, groin, or genital area)?\nAre there other symptoms, such as frequent or urgent urination? Burning during urination? Fever or chills?\n\n 3.Follow Up\nMost causes of blood in the urine are not serious, but some are. The health care provider may order one or more of these tests\nUrinalysis to check for urinary tract infection or kidney disease\nBlood test to check for kidney disease\nKidney imaging studies to check for a tumor, kidney or bladder stone, enlarged prostate, or blockage to urine flow\nCystoscopic examination (looking at the inside of the bladder with a very thin scope) to check for a tumor or bladder stone\n\nWhat are the symptoms of hematuria?\nMost people with microscopic hematuria do not have symptoms. People with gross hematuria have urine that is pink, red, or cola-colored due to the presence of red blood cells (RBCs). Even a small amount of blood in the urine can cause urine to change color. In most cases, people with gross hematuria do not have other symptoms. However, people with gross hematuria that includes blood clots in the urine may have pain.\n\nWhat is the urinary tract?\nThe urinary tract is the body’s drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located near the middle of the back, just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys process about 200 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra water. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. The bladder stores urine until releasing it through urination. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.\n\nWhat causes hematuria?\nHematuria can be caused by menstruation, vigorous exercise, sexual activity, viral illness, trauma, or infection, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI). More serious causes of hematuria include\ncancer of the kidney or bladder\ninflammation of the kidney, urethra, bladder, or prostate—a walnut-shaped gland in men that surrounds the urethra at the neck of the bladder and supplies fluid that goes into semen\npolycystic kidney disease—an inherited disorder characterized by many grape-like clusters of fluid-filled cysts that make both kidneys larger over time, taking over and destroying working kidney tissue\nblood clots\nblood clotting disorders, such as hemophilia\nsickle cell disease—an inherited disorder in which RBCs form an abnormal crescent shape, resulting in less oxygen delivered to the body’s tissues, clogging of small blood vessels, and disruption of healthy blood flow\n\nWho is at risk for hematuria?\nAlmost anyone, including children and teens, can have hematuria. Factors that increase the chance a person will have hematuria include\na family history of kidney disease\nan enlarged prostate, which typically occurs in men age 50 or older\nurinary stone disease\ncertain medications including aspirin and other pain relievers, blood thinners, and antibiotics\nstrenuous exercise such as long-distance running\na recent bacterial or viral infection", "Call the doctor immedialty  if the person has\nYou think the food poisoning may be from seafood or mushrooms.\nThe person is severely dehydrated.\n\n1.Control Nausea and Vomiting\nAvoid solid foods until vomiting ends. Then eat light, bland foods, such as saltine crackers, bananas, rice, or bread.\nSipping liquids may help avoid vomiting.\nDon’t eat fried, greasy, spicy, or sweet foods.\nDon’t take anti-nausea or anti-diarrhea medication without asking your doctor. They may make some kinds of diarrhea worse. Your doctor may give you anti-nausea medication if you are at risk of being dehydrated.\n\n2. Prevent Dehydration\nDrink clear fluids, starting with small sips and gradually drinking more.\nIf vomiting and diarrhea last more than 24 hours, drink an oral rehydration solution.\n\n3. When to Call a Doctor\nCall a doctor immediately if symptoms last more than 3 days and include\nSevere belly pain\nFever\nBloody diarrhea or dark stools\nVomiting that is prolonged or bloody\nSigns of dehydration, such as dry mouth, decreased urination, dizziness, fatigue, or increased heart rate or breathing rate\n\nMore about food poisoning and foodborne illnesses \n\nWhat causes foodborne illnesses?\nThe majority of foodborne illnesses are caused by harmful bacteria and viruses.2 Some parasites and chemicals also cause foodborne illnesses.\nBacteria\nBacteria are tiny organisms that can cause infections of the GI tract. Not all bacteria are harmful to humans.\nSome harmful bacteria may already be present in foods when they are purchased. Raw foods including meat, poultry, fish and shellfish, eggs, unpasteurized milk and dairy products, and fresh produce often contain bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. Bacteria can contaminate food—making it harmful to eat—at any time during growth, harvesting or slaughter, processing, storage, and shipping.\nFoods may also be contaminated with bacteria during food preparation in a restaurant or home kitchen. If food preparers do not thoroughly wash their hands, kitchen utensils, cutting boards, and other kitchen surfaces that come into contact with raw foods, cross-contamination—the spread of bacteria from contaminated food to uncontaminated food—may occur.\nIf hot food is not kept hot enough or cold food is not kept cold enough, bacteria may multiply. Bacteria multiply quickly when the temperature of food is between 40 and 140 degrees. Cold food should be kept below 40 degrees and hot food should be kept above 140 degrees. Bacteria multiply more slowly when food is refrigerated, and freezing food can further slow or even stop the spread of bacteria. However, bacteria in refrigerated or frozen foods become active again when food is brought to room temperature. Thoroughly cooking food kills bacteria.\n\nMany types of bacteria cause foodborne illnesses. Examples include\nSalmonella, a bacterium found in many foods, including raw and undercooked meat, poultry, dairy products, and seafood. Salmonella may also be present on egg shells and inside eggs.\nCampylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), found in raw or undercooked chicken and unpasteurized milk.\nShigella, a bacterium spread from person to person. These bacteria are present in the stools of people who are infected. If people who are infected do not wash their hands thoroughly after using the bathroom, they can contaminate food that they handle or prepare. Water contaminated with infected stools can also contaminate produce in the field.\nEscherichia coli (E. coli), which includes several different strains, only a few of which cause illness in humans. E. coli O157:H7 is the strain that causes the most severe illness. Common sources of E. coli include raw or undercooked hamburger, unpasteurized fruit juices and milk, and fresh produce.\nListeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), which has been found in raw and undercooked meats, unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, and ready-to-eat deli meats and hot dogs.\nVibrio, a bacterium that may contaminate fish or shellfish.\nClostridium botulinum (C. botulinum), a bacterium that may contaminate improperly canned foods and smoked and salted fish.\n\nWho gets foodborne illnesses?\nAnyone can get a foodborne illness. However, some people are more likely to develop foodborne illnesses than others, including\ninfants and children\npregnant women and their fetuses\nolder adults\npeople with weak immune systems\nThese groups also have a greater risk of developing severe symptoms or complications of foodborne illnesses.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of foodborne illnesses?\nSymptoms of foodborne illnesses depend on the cause. Common symptoms of many foodborne illnesses include\nvomiting\ndiarrhea or bloody diarrhea\nabdominal pain\nfever\nchills\nSymptoms can range from mild to serious and can last from a few hours to several days.", "Call the doctor immedialty  if the person has\n\nTrouble breathing\nFeelings of faintness or dizziness\nHives\nA swollen tongue\nA history of severe allergy reaction to insect stings\nInject epinephrine if the person is unable to.

Sometimes-especially with bees-the stinger may be left in the skin. The venom is poisonous and may cause direct injury to the human body. This injury is usually confined to the areas close to the sting or stings.\nAllergic reaction: The vast majority of serious medical problems and deaths result from an allergic reaction. This happens in certain people whose immune systems are overly sensitive (or allergic) to the venom. When they get stung, their body may overreact to the venom, and an allergic reaction may happen throughout their body. These people are frequently described as being allergic to specific insect stings.\nSome people may die from insect venom anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction). These fatal allergic reactions frequently, but not always, occur in people who have had a previous allergic reaction to the same type of insect.\nAlthough multiple stings increase the potential danger in allergic cases, a serious or even fatal allergic reaction can (and does) occur from a single sting in a person with no known prior allergic reaction.\nThe vast majority of serious and fatal allergic reactions from stings cause a significant and obvious allergic reaction within an hour of being stung. Most deaths from stings occur within the first hour. Immediate emergency medical care is critical in known or suspected allergic reactions after an insect sting. In rare cases, serious or even fatal allergic reactions may not happen for up to four or more hours after an insect sting.\n\nOther complications: Insect stings in nonallergic people, though perhaps painful, usually do not cause serious problems. However, multiple stings may cause serious complications (such as muscle breakdown or kidney failure) and, rarely, even death in nonallergic people.\nEspecially at increased risk are small children, elderly people, and people who are already weak. These serious problems may occur within the first few hours of being stung or may be delayed for days after being stung.\nEven a single sting in the mouth or throat can cause swelling and obstruction of the airway. Children are at increased risk for these types of breathing problems from a sting.\nA bacterial skin infection at the sting site may also develop.\n\nBee and Wasp Stings Symptoms\nThe severity of a sting is determined by a number of factors. The type of insect, the location of the sting, the number of stings, and the allergic sensitivity of the victim can all affect the outcome. Most people do not have allergic reactions to bee and wasp stings.\nMedical problems from bee and wasp stings are broadly broken down into two categories\nLocal reactions (only the part of the body near the sting is affected)\nImmediate pain, redness, swelling, and itching at the sting site may occur.\nA large (greater than four inches across) local reaction may develop over the next 12-36 hours.\nA bacterial skin infection, although uncommon, may also begin during the first 12-36 hours (or even after the first few days).\nThese may cause an enlarging area of redness at the sting site. It may be difficult to tell a local skin reaction and a local bacterial skin infection apart.\nSystemic or allergic reactions (parts of the body away from the sting are affected)\nHives (raised itchy bumps on the skin) and itching all over the body\nSwelling of the mouth or throat or both\nWheezing\nShortness of breath or other difficulty breathing\nNausea\nVomiting\nAnxiety\nChest pain\nLow blood pressure (weakness or fainting)\nIn severe cases, marked difficulty breathing, unconsciousness, and even death may occur", "\n\nSymptoms of a broken toe include: pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty walking.\n1. Prevent Swelling and Further Injury\nStay off the foot as much as possible.\nAvoid movement or pressure that causes pain.\nApply ice up to 20 minutes at a time. Wrap it in a towel; do not apply directly to skin.\nKeep the foot elevated as often as possible, especially the first 2 days after injury, to help control pain and swelling.\nFor pain, take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\n\n2. Get Help\nIf you have severe pain, can’t walk, the toe looks bent or deformed, or the pain lasts for a long time, see a doctor.\n\n3. Follow Up\nStay off your foot and avoid activity that causes pain for 3-4 weeks.\nWear a shoe with a stiff sole to protect the injured toe and keep it stable. Avoid shoes that put pressure on the toe.\n\nToe and Forefoot Fractures\nNearly one-fourth of all the bones in your body are in your feet, which provide you with both support and movement. A broken (fractured) bone in your forefoot (metatarsals) or in one of your toes (phalanges) is often painful but rarely disabling. Most of the time, these injuries heal without operative treatment.\n\nTypes of fractures\nStress fractures frequently occur in the bones of the forefoot that extend from your toes to the middle of your foot. Stress fractures are like tiny cracks in the bone surface. They can occur with sudden increases in training (such as running or walking for longer distances or times), improper training techniques or changes in training surfaces. Most other types of fractures extend through the bone. They may be stable (no shift in bone alignment) or displaced (bone ends no longer line up). These fractures usually result from trauma, such as dropping a heavy object on your foot, or from a twisting injury. If the fractured bone does not break through the skin, it is called a closed fracture.\nSeveral types of fractures occur to the forefoot bone on the side of the little toe (fifth metatarsal). Ballet dancers may break this bone during a misstep or fall from a pointe position. An ankle-twisting injury may tear the tendon that attaches to this bone and pull a small piece of the bone away. A more serious injury in the same area is a Jones fracture, which occurs near the base of the bone and disrupting the blood supply to the bone. This injury may take longer to heal or require surgery.\n\nSymptoms\nPain, swelling, and sometimes bruising are the most common signs of a fracture in the foot. If you have a broken toe, you may be able to walk, but this usually aggravates the pain. If the pain, swelling, and discoloration continue for more than two or three days, or if pain interferes with walking, something could be seriously wrong; see a doctor as soon as possible. If you delay getting treatment, you could develop persistent foot pain and arthritis. You could also change the way you walk (your gait), which could lead to the formation of painful calluses on the bottom of your foot or other injuries.\n\nTreatment\nSee a doctor as soon as possible if you think that you have a broken bone in your foot or toe. Until your appointment, keep weight off the leg and apply ice to reduce swelling. Use an ice pack or wrap the ice in a towel so it does not come into direct contact with the skin. Apply the ice for no more than 20 minutes at a time. Take an analgesic such as aspirin or ibuprofen to help relieve the pain. Wear a wider shoe with a stiff sole.\nRest is the primary treatment for stress fractures in the foot. Stay away from the activity that triggered the injury, or any activity that causes pain at the fracture site, for three to four weeks. Substitute another activity that puts less pressure on the foot, such as swimming. Gradually, you will be able to return to activity. Your doctor or coach may be able to help you pinpoint the training errors that caused the initial problem so you can avoid a recurrence.\nThe bone ends of a displaced fracture must be realigned and the bone kept immobile until healing takes place. If you have a broken toe, the doctor will buddy-tape the broken toe to an adjacent toe, with a gauze pad between the toes to absorb moisture. You should replace the gauze and tape as often as needed. Remove or replace the tape if swelling increases and the toes feel numb or look pale. If you are diabetic or have peripheral neuropathy (numbness of the toes), do not tape the toes together. You may need to wear a rigid flat-bottom orthopaedic shoe for two to three weeks.\nIf you have a broken bone in your forefoot, you may have to wear a short-leg walking cast, a brace, or a rigid, flat-bottom shoe. It could take six to eight weeks for the bone to heal, depending on the location and extent of the injury. After a week or so, the doctor may request another set of X-rays to ensure that the bones remain properly aligned. As symptoms subside, you can put some weight on the leg. Stop if the pain returns.\nSurgery is rarely required to treat fractures in the toes or forefoot. However, when it is necessary, it has a high degree of success.\n\nCauses\nA toe fracture is caused by trauma to the bone. Trauma can result from\nDropping something on your toe\nStubbing your toe\nFalling down\nA direct blow to the toe\n\nRisk Factors\nFactors that may increase your chance of a toe fracture include\nAdvanced age\nOsteoporosis\nPoor nutrition\nParticipating in contact sports\nNot wearing shoes\n\nSymptoms\nA toe fracture may cause\nPain\nSwelling and tenderness\nStiffness in the injured area\nInability to move toe\nBruising in injured area\nNumbness or tingling in the toes\nVisible deformity in the toe area\nDifficulty walking (sometimes)\n\nInitial Care\nExtra support may be needed to protect, support, and keep your toe in line while it heals. Supportive steps may include buddy taping (your injured toe is taped to healthy toes next to it), a walking cast, or a shoe with a stiff bottom.\nSome fractures cause pieces of bone to separate. Your doctor will need to put these pieces back into their proper place. This may be done\nWithout surgery—you will have anesthesia to decrease pain while the doctor moves the pieces back into place\nWith surgery—pins or screws may be needed to reconnect the pieces and hold them in place\nChildren’s bones are still growing at an area of the bone called the growth plate. If the fracture affected the growth plate, your child may need to see a specialist. Injuries to the growth plate will need to be monitored to make sure the bone can continue to grow as expected.", "Frostbite is the freezing of a specific body part such as fingers, toes, the nose or earlobes.Call the doctor immedialty  if the person has\nA part of the person's body or skin is turning white and hard or black.\nThe person has lack of feeling in the area.\nThe person shows signs of hypothermia.\n\n1. Seek Medical Care Promptly\nSee a doctor or go to a hospital emergency room.\n\n2. Restore Warmth\nUntil you can see a doctor\nGet the person to a warm place and remove any wet clothing.\nUnless absolutely necessary, the person should not walk on frostbitten toes or feet.\nDo not rewarm the skin until you can keep it warm. Warming and then re-exposing the frostbitten area to cold air can cause worse damage.\nGently warm the area in warm water (not hot) or with wet heat until the skin appears red and warm.\nIf no water is nearby, breathe on the area through cupped hands and hold it next to your body.\nDo not use direct heat from heating pads, radiator, or fires.\nDo not rub or massage the skin or break blisters.\n\n3. Bandage the Area\nLoosely apply dry, sterile dressings.\nPut gauze or clean cotton balls between fingers or toes to keep them separated.\n4. Follow Up\nOnce you get medical care, the next steps depend on the particular case.\nAt the hospital, a doctor will rewarm the area.\nThe doctor may administer medication for pain or intravenous fluids if the person is dehydrated.\nThe doctor may also give a tetanus vaccine.\nThe person may be hospitalized for a few days.\n\nSigns/Symptoms of Frostbite?\nSkin becomes white and waxy in appearance\nFrostbitten limbs become hard like a piece of wood\nTingling feeling in limbs, followed by numbness\nAching or throbbing in limbs\n\nSymptoms for severe frostbite include\nBlisters\nGangrene (blackened limbs that result from dead tissue)\nTendons, muscles, or nerves may become damaged\n\nHow do you treat Frostbite?\nAccording to the Red Cross and Medline Plus, in order to treat Frostbite you should\nHandle the person gently. Do not rub the affected area.\nMove the person to a warmer area or try to shelter them from the cold.\nSince Frost bite is a precursor to hypothermia, and at times accompanies it, check for signs of hypothermia in the victim and treat them accordingly.\nWarm the frostbitten area by soaking it in warm water (not hot water) until it is red and feels warm.\nWrap the area in sterile dressings.\nIf fingers or toes are frozen, place gauze between them to keep them separated.\nDO NOT let the area refreeze (refreezing and thawing causes the most damage to tissues).\nDO NOT break any blisters.\nGet Medical attention quickly.\nHypothermia\nAccording to Wilderness and Travel Medicine, Hypothermia is when body temperature lowers drastically below 98.6°F. Those suffering from hypothermia whose core body temperature lowers to 90°F (32°C) are victims of mild to moderate hypothermia.\nIf the core body temperature drops to 83°F (28°C), the heart begins to beat irregularly. Once the core body temperature lowers to 75-80°F (24-27°C) the person may die.\nYour goal is to try to bring their body temperature back to a normal level until medical attention arrives.\n\nIMPORTANT\nAs you try to restore normal body temperature, warm their body slowly. Warming the body too quickly can cause shock and serious heart arrhythmias.\nWarm slowly by gradually wrapping blankets or putting warm clothing on their body\nDO NOT submerge any of the body in warm water, nor put on an electric heating pad, or heating lamp as this can cause skin damage and irregular heartbeat.\n\nHow can I prevent Frostbite and Hypothermia?\nThese prevention techniques are especially applicable to those who like to do outdoor winter activities like snowboarding, skiing, snowshoeing, etc.\nWindmilling for Warmth\nThis is a cool trick from Wilderness and Travel Medicine\nIf you are experiencing Frostnip or begin to start feeling numbness in your fingers swing your arms around in a circle like a windmill for a few minutes. This will increase blood flow to your hands and fingers, delaying the onset of frostbite\nCome out of the cold in regular intervals to warm up and relieve yourself of the cold\nEat a well-balanced, carbohydrate-rich meal before going out in the cold so your body will have the energy to help you maintain your core body temperature.\nIf you notice any tingling or numbness, get out of the cold\nKeep yourself dry. Bring extra clothes so that you can change immediately if you get wet.\nWear lots of layers and adjust as needed if you start to sweat.\nWatch the weather; if the forecast predicts extreme temperatures, stay inside.\nHave available at least 1 wind-proof layer.\nIn a nutshell, if you’re ever in the cold, make sure that you bundle up and take regular breaks from extreme conditions to warm yourself up.\nIf you’re forced to be in the cold because of an emergency (your car breaks down in the cold, for example) make sure you’re prepared. Store blankets, extra clothes, hand warmers, and matches in your car emergency kit so you won’t suffer from the extreme effects of hypothermia and frostbite.", "\n\n1. Control Swelling With RICE Therapy\nRICE stands for\nRest the sprained or strained area. If necessary, use a sling for an arm injury or crutches for a leg or foot injury. Splint an injured finger or toe by taping it to an adjacent finger or toe.\nIce for 20 minutes every hour. Never put ice directly against the skin or it may damage the skin. Use a thin towel for protection.\nCompress by wrapping an elastic (Ace) bandage or sleeve lightly (not tightly) around the joint or limb. Specialized braces, such as for the ankle, can work better than an elastic bandage for removing the swelling.\nElevate the area above heart level if possible.\n\n2. Manage Pain and Inflammation\nGive an over-the-counter NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or aspirin. Do not give aspirin to anyone under age 19.\n3. See a Doctor\nAll but the most minor strains and sprains should be evaluated by a doctor. Consult a doctor as soon as possible if there are symptoms of a possible broken bone\nThere is a popping sound with the injury.\nThe person can't move the injured joint or limb.\nThe limb buckles when the injured joint is used.\nThere is numbness.\nThere is significant swelling, pain, fever, or open cuts.\n\n4. Follow Up\nContinue RICE for 24 to 48 hours, or until the person sees a doctor.\nThe doctor may want to do X-rays or an MRI to diagnose a severe sprain or strain or rule out a broken bone.\nThe doctor may need to immobilize the limb or joint with a splint, cast, or other device until healing is complete. Physical therapy can often be helpful to bring an injured joint back to normal.\nIn severe cases, surgery may be needed.\n\nWhat Causes a Sprain?\nMany things can cause a sprain. Falling, twisting, or getting hit can force a joint out of its normal position. This can cause ligaments around the joint to stretch or tear. Sprains can occur if people\nFall and land on an arm.\nFall on the side of their foot.\nTwist a knee.\n\nWhere Do Sprains Usually Occur?\nSprains happen most often in the ankle. Sometimes when people fall and land on their hand, they sprain their wrist. A sprain to the thumb is common in skiing and other sports.\n\nWhat Are the Signs and Symptoms of Sprains?\nThe usual signs and symptoms of a sprain are\nPain\nSwelling\nBruising\nNot being able to move or use the joint.\nWhat Is a Strain?\nA strain is an injury to a muscle or a tendon (tissue that connects muscle to bone). In a strain, a muscle or tendon is stretched or torn.\n\nWhat Causes Strains?\nA strain is caused by twisting or pulling a muscle or tendon. Strains can happen suddenly or develop over days or weeks. A sudden (acute) strain is caused by\nA recent injury\nLifting heavy objects the wrong way\nOverstressing the muscles.\nChronic strains are usually caused by moving the muscles and tendons the same way over and over.\n\nWhere Do Strains Usually Occur?\nTwo common sites for a strain are the back and the hamstring muscle in the back of the thigh. Sports such as soccer, football, hockey, boxing, and wrestling put people at risk for strains in the back or legs. People who play some sports use their hands and arms a lot. Examples are gymnastics, tennis, rowing, and golf. People who play these sports sometimes strain their hand or arm. Elbow strains can also happen when playing sports.\n\nWhat Are the Signs and Symptoms of Strains?\nA strain can cause\nPain\nMuscle spasms\nMuscle weakness\nSwelling\nCramping\nTrouble moving the muscle.\nIf a muscle or tendon is torn completely, it is often very painful and hard to move.\nHow Are Sprains and Strains Treated?\nTreatments for sprains and strains are the same. To reduce swelling and pain in the first day or two, doctors usually say to\nRest the injured area. If the ankle or knee is hurt, the doctor might tell you to use crutches or a cane.\nPut ice on the injury for 20 minutes at a time. The doctor might say to do this 4 to 8 times a day.\nCompress (squeeze) the injury using special bandages, casts, boots, or splints. Your doctor will tell you which one is best for you and how tight it should be.\nPut the injured ankle, knee, elbow, or wrist up on a pillow.\nThe doctor may recommend taking medicines, such as aspirin or ibuprofen.\nAfter treating pain and swelling, doctors usually say to exercise the injured area. This helps to prevent stiffness and increase strength. Some people need physical therapy. You may need to exercise the injured area or go to physical therapy for several weeks. Your doctor or physical therapist will tell you when you can start to do normal activities, including sports. If you begin too soon, you can injure the area again.\nIt is important to see a doctor if you have a painful sprain or strain. This helps you get the right treatments.\n\nCan Sprains and Strains Be Prevented?\nTo help prevent sprains and strains, you can\nAvoid exercising or playing sports when tired or in pain.\nEat a well-balanced diet to keep muscles strong.\nMaintain a healthy weight.\nTry to avoid falling (for example, put sand or salt on icy spots on your front steps or sidewalks).\nWear shoes that fit well.\nGet new shoes if the heel wears down on one side.\nExercise every day.\nBe in proper physical condition to play a sport.\nWarm up and stretch before playing a sport.\nWear protective equipment when playing.\nRun on flat surfaces.", "\nTreating a Bruise at Home\n\n1. Reduce Bruising and Swelling\nIce the area on and off for the first 24-48 hours.\nApply ice for about 15 minutes at a time, and always put something like a towel or wash cloth between the ice and your skin.\nRest the affected area.\nIf possible, elevate the affected area.\n\n2. Treat Symptoms\nFor pain, take acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Alleve).\n\n3. When to Call a Doctor\nIf bruise is accompanied by extreme pain, swelling or redness\nIf the person is taking a blood-thinning medication\nIf bruises appear on skin for no apparent reason\nThe bruise in on the face or head\nYou can’t move a joint\nYou may have a broken bone\n\n4. Follow Up\nTwo days after a bruise develops, apply a heat pack or wash cloth soaked in warm water to the area several times a day to promote healing.\nPain and tenderness should get better within a few days and the bruise should go away within a couple of weeks.\n\nBruises Causes and Risk Factors\nPeople typically get bruises when they bump into something or when something bumps into them. Risk factors for bruises include the following\nBruises can occur in some people who exercise rigorously, such as athletes and weight lifters. These bruises result from microscopic tears in blood vessels under the skin. Bruising in athletes can also result from direct impact/trauma and be accompanied by an underlying hematoma.\nUnexplained, random bruises that occur easily or for no apparent reason may indicate a bleeding disorder or result from blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants), especially if the bruising is accompanied by frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums.\nOften, what are thought to be unexplained bruises on the shin or the thigh, for example, actually result from bumps into a bedpost or other object and failing to recall the injury.\nBruises in elderly people frequently occur because their skin has become thinner with age. The tissues that support the underlying blood vessels have become more fragile.\nBruising occurs more commonly with vitamin C deficiency (ascorbic acid deficiency or scurvy).\nBruising can be a sign of physical abuse of the child (child abuse).\n\nBruises Symptoms and Signs\nInitially, a fresh bruise may actually be reddish. It will then turn blue or dark purple within a few hours, then yellow or green after a few days as it heals.\nA bruise is commonly tender and sometimes even painful for the first few days, but the pain usually goes away as the color fades.\nBecause the skin is not broken in a bruise as with a scrape or cut there is little risk of infection.\nRepeated bruising of an area can leave permanent yellowish-brown staining from iron depositing in the skin.\n\nWhen to Seek Medical Care for a Bruise\nCall the doctor if the bruise is accompanied by swelling and extreme pain.\nCall the doctor if one is taking a blood-thinning medication for a medical condition and notices significant bruising.\nCall the doctor if bruises occur easily or if bruises appear for no reason.\nCall the doctor if the bruise is painful and under a toenail or fingernail.\nCall the doctor if a bruise does not improve within two weeks or fails to completely clear after three or four weeks, or if a bruise won't go away.\nGo to the hospital's emergency department if one thinks he/she has a broken bone along with the bruise.\nSome bruises, such as those on the head or the eye, can cause a lot of anxiety.\nIf a bruise or hematoma occurs on the head (sometimes called a goose egg), but the person did not black out, is able to remember the accident, is not on blood thinners, and does not have dizziness, nausea, or vomiting, then it may not be a serious head injury. On the other hand, if the person cannot remember what happened, a concussion is suspected, or if there are any concerns about the injury, he or she should be taken to the nearest emergency department.\nIf a bruise occurs on the face just above the eye, one can expect the bruise to travel to the area just under the eye, possibly causing a black eye, because of the effects of gravity. As long as someone is able to move the affected eye in all directions and does not have vision changes or a headache, it may not be a serious injury that requires a visit to the hospital. If there are any concerns about injury to the eye, see a doctor.\n\nBruises Treatment\nDoctors have no special treatment for bruises other than the techniques described under home remedies: ice packs and later heat, over-the-counter medications for pain, and elevation of the bruised area, if possible.\nA suspected victim of domestic abuse may be referred to a law-enforcement official and/or a social worker.\n\nPrevention of BruisesWear protective gear while playing contact sports such as soccer, football, or hockey.\nPlace furniture away from doorways and common walking paths within the home.\nKeep phone and electrical cords away from open areas where one may trip and fall.\nBe sure floors are kept dry and rugs are slip resistant.\nKeep floors free of clutter.\nInstall a small night light or use a flashlight if one needs to walk to the bathroom during the night.\nIf a doctor has prescribed anticoagulant medications (blood thinners), have regular monitoring and adjust medications as necessary.", "Call the doctor immedialty  if the person has\n\nDizziness\nConfusion\nLight-headedness\nPassing out\nShortness of breath\nPain, pressure, or tightness in the chest, neck, jaw, arms, or upper back\n\n1. Take Steps to Reduce Heart Palpitations\nLeave a stressful situation and try to be calm. Anxiety, stress, fear, or panic can cause palpitations.\nCut back on coffee, tea, chocolate, and colas if caffeine seems to cause palpitations.\nDon’t smoke or use tobacco products. Nicotine can cause palpitations.\nDon’t drink alcohol.\nAvoid illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines.\nAvoid medications that act like stimulants, such as cough and cold medicines or decongestants.\n\n2. Follow Up\nCall your doctor for an appointment. Often, palpitations aren’t serious, but they can be related to abnormal heart valves, heart rhythm problems, or panic attacks.\nAlways call a doctor if palpitations change in nature or increase suddenly.\n\nWhat are heart palpitations?\nHeart palpitations are heartbeat sensations that you suddenly become aware of because they feel like your heart is “pounding�? or “racing.�? They may feel like you have exercised or they may feel like a flutter, a skipped or extra beat, or a heartbeat that simply does not feel normal. Palpitations can occur at any time -- while you are simply sitting or moving about normally as you perform your daily activities.\nPalpitations can be felt in your chest, throat or neck. Although heart palpitations may be startling, they may or may not be related to an abnormal heart rate and are often not serious or harmful.\n\nWhat causes heart palpitations?\nHeart palpitations may be caused by\nEmotions, such as anxiety, stress, fear, panic\nExercise\nPregnancy\nCaffeine found in coffee, teas, chocolate, colas, some sports drinks and foods\nCertain medical conditions: overactive thyroid, low blood sugar, low potassium level, low oxygen level or low carbon dioxide level in the blood, fever, anemia, dehydration, loss of blood, shock\nCertain medications: asthma inhalers and decongestants, beta blockers (taken for high blood pressure or heart disease), thyroid and antiarrhythmic medications, and some over-the-counter medications that act as stimulants, such as cough and cold medicines, and some herbal or nutritional supplements\nIllegal street drugs: cocaine and amphetamines (speed)\nNicotine found in tobacco products\n\nSymptoms andDiagnosis\nSymptoms of palpitations are more likely to be related to an abnormal heart rhythm if you have\nSignificant risk factors for heart disease\nExisting heart disease\nHeart rhythm problems – also called irregular heartbeats or arrhythmias (a change in rhythm of your heartbeat)\nAbnormal heart valve\n\nAre palpitations a symptom of a more serious health problem?\nPalpitations may be a sign of a more serious health problem if you also feel\nDizzy\nConfused\nLight-headed\nHave trouble breathing\nPass out while experiencing the palpitations\nIf you experience these symptoms, call your doctor’s office right away. Also call your doctor’s office if the palpitations are accompanied by pain, pressure, or tightness in your chest, neck, jaw, arms, or upper back; shortness of breath; unusual sweating; or if you experience new or worsening symptoms.\n\nTreatmentOptions\nTreatment depends on what is causing the palpitations. Your doctor will use the results of the diagnostic tests to determine if you have any underlying heart disease causing the symptoms. He or she will also see if the symptom is actually related to an abnormal heart rhythm. In most cases, if you are otherwise healthy, no treatment will be necessary. If you notice palpitations occur with certain activities or food, you should avoid those activities.\nIf the heart palpitations bother you and you have other health problems, your doctor will determine an appropriate treatment plan that may include medications or more invasive procedures, surgery or implantation of an electrical to restore a normal heart rhythm, or correct an underlying heart problem\n\nWhat can I do to prevent palpitations?\nTo help lessen heart palpitations\nDecrease your stress level (Learn biofeedback, deep breathing and/or relaxation exercises such as yoga, tai chi, or guided imagery)\nLimit alcohol\nLimit caffeinated beverages\nDo not smoke or use tobacco products\nExercise on a regular basis (Ask your doctor what exercise program is right for you)\nAvoid certain activities that appear to be associated with palpitations\nAvoid certain medications that act as stimulants, such as cough and cold medicines, and some herbal or nutritional supplements\nMake sure your blood pressure and cholesterol are well controlled\nTry not to pay attention to your heart palpitations once any serious causes have been ruled out.\n\nTo help your doctor diagnose your condition, keep track of your heart palpitations. Note when they happen, how long they last, how you are feeling when they occur, and if you are doing an activity when they occur. Share this information with your doctor. If you notice a sudden increase in the palpitations or any type of change in them, call your doctor. Keep all scheduled follow-up visits with your doctor so your condition can be monitored.", "Call the doctor immedialty  if the person has\nDoes not seem to be responding appropriately\nHas a seizure, visual changes, or any other neurologic symptoms; these could be symptoms of severe heat illness.\n\nCall a health care provider if\nThe burn has blisters or the skin is white-appearing or numb.

There is a dark side to the sun. The US government has officially identified ultraviolet radiation (UVR) both from the sun and from tanning machines as a known cause of cancer in humans. UVR produces DNA damage that may lead to mutations (abnormalities) in genes involved in the development of skin cancer. Therefore, along with other sun safety strategies, sunscreens that absorb or block UVR serve an important protective function.\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the sun causes 90 percent of all nonmelanoma skin cancers,1 and other research links it to 65 percent of all melanomas.2 Each year, an estimated 3.5 million or more new cases occur in the US of the nonmelanoma skin cancers basal and squamous cell carcinoma (BCC and SCC).3 An estimated 76,250 new cases of invasive melanoma, the most dangerous form of skin cancer, will be diagnosed in the US in 2012, with nearly 9,180 resulting in death, according to the American Cancer Society.4Photoaging, or UV-induced skin aging, is another long-term result of sun exposure. While not threatening to life, it is threatening to quality of life. Excessive unprotected time in the sun leads to premature wrinkling, sagging, a leathery texture and hyperpigmentation (so-called “aging spots�? or “liver spots�? that are really the result of sun damage).\nSunburn, the most immediate, obvious example of UVR damage, results from sun-induced inflammation and/or blistering of the skin. When immune cells called mast cells race to the injured skin site in response to the damage, they dilate the blood vessels and produce erythema (reddening), edema (swelling), and burning and stinging sensations as part of the healing process. This DNA damage can be the first step towards skin cancer. Intermittent, intense UVR exposure, often producing sunburn, is believed to be more closely associated with melanoma than is chronic sun exposure. One blistering sunburn in childhood or adolescence doubles the risk of melanoma later in life; five sunburns by any age doubles the risk as well.5 UVR also weakens immune surveillance mechanisms, allowing tumor cells to proliferate more freely. This effect adds to the immune suppression induced by other causes, including cancer chemotherapy and antirejection drugs for transplants.5 Sunscreen is one vital tool that can help prevent all of these UVR-induced assaults on the body as part of a comprehensive photoprotection program, along with sun avoidance or use of shade during peak sunlight hours (10 AM to 4 PM), and protective clothing, including a wide-brimmed hat and UVR-blocking sunglasses. \n\nWhat are the major risk factors for skin cancer?\nA. Heredity has a major role; entire families can be melanoma-prone. In general, fair-skinned individuals, skin types I and II, living between 0º and 45º north or south latitudes (the hottest, most equatorial zones), are at highest risk for skin cancer. They generally have blond or red hair, blue or hazel eyes, burn easily and tan minimally or not at all. People with many moles or any large, atypical moles are also at higher risk.\nFinally, both intermittent, intense exposure (the kind you get on vacation on a sunny isle, often leading to sunburn) and chronic lifetime exposure add to skin cancer risk. Studies have shown that chronic sun exposure is most associated with the development of squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common skin cancer, while both chronic and intense, intermittent exposure are believed to play a role in basal cell carcinoma,7,8 the most common skin cancer. \n\nShould sunscreen be used only by people at high risk?\nA. Although people with dark skin are not as high-risk as those with light skin, they develop skin cancer too and should use sunscreen. Dyspigmentation (abnormal increase or decrease in the production or distribution of pigment in the skin) is also a major concern for many dark-skinned individuals, and can be minimized by photoprotection, including regular sunscreen use. For adequate protection against melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancers and photoaging, everyone over the age of six months should use sunscreen daily year-round, in any weather. (Infants should be kept out of the sun or protected with clothing and an umbrella or stroller hood.)\nSunscreen should not be neglected on overcast days, as 70-80 percent of the sun's rays – above all, long-spectrum UVA rays – go through clouds and fog. In addition, according to the World Health Organization, UVR levels rise by about 4 to 5 percent for every 1000 feet of altitude, and reflection from sand, water, snow or concrete magnifies their effects by up to 80 percent.\n\n How does photosensitivity add to the risk?A. Phototoxicity can result when a person uses one or another of a wide range of photosensitizing products and then is exposed to UVR. Typically, hours after the exposure, the initial reaction, resembling a severe sunburn, appears. Many of the sensitizing agents are drugs, such as the antibiotics tetracycline, doxycycline and ciprofloxacin; the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen; and the diuretic furosemide, as well as retinoids. Photoallergy, like other allergies, occurs in previously sensitized individuals. Repeat exposure to the same allergen plus UVR exposure prompts a typical pruritic (intense itching) and eczematous reaction. In some individuals, even certain sunscreen ingredients cause photoallergy; these people should switch sunscreens.

There are 3 degrees of burns\nFirst-degree burns are red and painful. They swell a little. They turn white when you press on the skin. The skin over the burn may peel off after 1 or 2 days.\nSecond-degree burns are thicker burns, are very painful and typically produce blisters on the skin. The skin is very red or splotchy, and may be very swollen.\nThird-degree burns cause damage to all layers of the skin. The burned skin looks white or charred. These burns may cause little or no pain because the nerves and tissue in the skin are damaged.\n\nHow long does it take for burns to heal?\nFirst-degree burns usually heal in 3 to 6 days.\nSecond-degree burns usually heal in 2 to 3 weeks.\nThird-degree burns usually take a very long time to heal.\n\nHow are burns treated?\nThe treatment depends on what kind of burn you have.\nSee a doctor if\nA first- or second-degree burn covers an area larger than 2 to 3 inches in diameter.\nThe burn is on your face, over a major joint (such as the knee or shoulder), on the hands, feet or genitals.\nThe burn is a third-degree burn, which requires immediate medical attention.\n\nFirst-degree burn\nSoak the burn in cool water for at least 5 minutes. The cool water helps reduce swelling by pulling heat away from the burned skin.\nTreat the burn with a skin care product that protects and heals skin, such as aloe vera cream or an antibiotic ointment. You can wrap a dry gauze bandage loosely around the burn. This will protect the area and keep the air off of it.\nTake an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (one brand name: Tylenol), ibuprofen (some brand names: Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (brand name: Aleve), to help with the pain. Ibuprofen and naproxen will also help with swelling.\n\nSecond-degree burnSoak the burn in cool water for 15 minutes. If the burned area is small, put cool, clean, wet cloths on the burn for a few minutes every day. Then put on an antibiotic cream, or other creams or ointments prescribed by your doctor. Cover the burn with a dry nonstick dressing (for example, Telfa) held in place with gauze or tape. Check with your doctor's office to make sure you are up-to-date on tetanus shots.\nChange the dressing every day. First, wash your hands with soap and water. Then gently wash the burn and put antibiotic ointment on it. If the burn area is small, a dressing may not be needed during the day. Check the burn every day for signs of infection, such as increased pain, redness, swelling or pus. If you see any of these signs, see your doctor right away. To prevent infection, avoid breaking any blisters that form.\nBurned skin itches as it heals. Keep your fingernails cut short and don't scratch the burned skin. The burned area will be sensitive to sunlight for up to one year, so you should apply sunscreen to the area when you're outside.\n\nThird-degree burn\n\nFor third-degree burns, go to the hospital right away. Don't take off any clothing that is stuck to the burn. Don't soak the burn in water or apply any ointment. If possible, raise the burned area above the level of the heart. You can cover the burn with a cool, wet sterile bandage or clean cloth until you receive medical assistance.\nIs there anything I shouldn't do when treating a burn?\nDo not put butter or oil on burns. Do not put ice or ice water directly on second- or third-degree burns. If blisters form over the burn, do not break them. These things can cause more damage to the skin.\n\nWhat do I need to know about electrical and chemical burns?\nA person who has an electrical burn (for example, from a power line) should go to the hospital right away. Electrical burns often cause serious injury to organs inside the body. This injury may not show on the skin.\nA chemical burn should be flushed with large amounts of cool water. Take off any clothing or jewelry that has the chemical on it. Don't put anything on the burned area, such as antibiotic ointment. This might start a chemical reaction that could make the burn worse. You can wrap the burn with dry, sterile gauze or a clean cloth. If you don't know what to do, call 911 or your local poison control center, or see your doctor right away.", "Call the doctor immedialty  if the person has\nHas a very high, weak pulse rate and rapid shallow breathing, especially when combined with high or low blood pressureIs unconscious, disoriented, or has a high body temperatureHas warm, dry skin, elevated or lowered blood pressure, and is hyperventilating\n1.

Children and persons over the age of 60 are particularly susceptible to dehydration.\n\nWhat causes dehydration?\nUnder normal conditions, we all lose body water daily through sweat, tears, breathing, urine, and stool. In a healthy person, this water is replaced by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water. When a person becomes so sick with fever, diarrhea, or vomiting, or if an individual is overexposed to the sun and not drinking enough water, dehydration occurs. This is caused when the body loses water content and essential body salts, such as sodium, potassium, calcium bicarbonate, and phosphate.\nOccasionally, dehydration can be caused by drugs, such as diuretics, which deplete body fluids and electrolytes. Whatever the cause, dehydration should be treated as soon as possible.\n\nsymptoms of dehydration?\nThe following are the most common symptoms of dehydration. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include\nThirst\nLess-frequent urination\nDry skin\nFatigue\nLight-headedness\nDizziness\nConfusion\nDry mouth and mucous membranes\nIncreased heart rate and breathing\n\nIn children, additional symptoms may include\nDry mouth and tongue\nNo tears when crying\nNo wet diapers for more than three hours\nSunken abdomen, eyes, or cheeks\nHigh fever\nListlessness\nIrritability\nSkin that does not flatten when pinched and released\nThe symptoms of dehydration may resemble other medical conditions or problems. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for dehydrationIf caught early, dehydration can often be treated at home under a physician's guidance. In children, directions for giving food and fluids will differ according to the cause of the dehydration, so it is important to consult your child's doctor.\nIn cases of mild dehydration, simple rehydration is recommended by drinking fluids. Many sports drinks on the market effectively restore body fluids, electrolytes, and salt balance.\nFor moderate dehydration, intravenous (IV) fluids may be required, although, if caught early enough, simple rehydration may be effective. Cases of serious dehydration should be treated as a medical emergency, and hospitalization, along with intravenous fluids, is necessary. Immediate action should be taken\nHow can dehydration be prevented?\nTake precautionary measures to avoid the harmful effects of dehydration, including the following\nDrink plenty of fluids, especially when working or playing in the sun.\nMake sure you are taking in more fluid than you are losing.\nTry to schedule physical outdoor activities for the cooler parts of the day.\nDrink appropriate sports drinks to help maintain electrolyte balance.\nFor infants and young children, solutions such as Pedialyte will help maintain electrolyte balance during illness or heat exposure. Do not try to make fluid and salt solutions at home for children.\n\nWhat is heat stroke?\nHeat stroke is the most severe form of heat illness and is a life-threatening emergency. It is the result of long, extreme exposure to the sun, in which a person does not sweat enough to lower body temperature. The elderly, infants, persons who work outdoors, people with mental illness, obesity, poor circulation, and those on certain types of medications or drinking alcohol are most susceptible to heat stroke. It is a condition that develops rapidly and requires immediate medical treatment.\n\nWhat causes heat stroke?\nOur bodies produce a tremendous amount of internal heat and we normally cool ourselves by sweating and radiating heat through the skin. However, in certain circumstances, such as extreme heat, high humidity, or vigorous activity in the hot sun, this cooling system may begin to fail, allowing heat to build up to dangerous levels.\nIf a person becomes dehydrated and cannot sweat enough to cool their body, their internal temperature may rise to dangerously high levels, causing heat stroke.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of heat stroke?\nThe following are the most common symptoms of heat stroke. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include\nHeadache\nDizziness\nDisorientation, agitation, or confusion\nSluggishness or fatigue\nSeizure\nHot, dry skin that is flushed but not sweaty\nA high body temperature\nLoss of consciousness\nRapid heartbeat\nHallucinations\nThe symptoms of a heat stroke may resemble other medical conditions or problems. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for heat stroke\nIt is important for the person to be treated immediately as heat stroke can cause permanent damage or death. There are some immediate first-aid measures you can take while waiting for help to arrive, including the following\nGet the person to a shaded area. \nRemove clothing and gently apply cool water to the skin followed by fanning to stimulate sweating.\nApply ice packs to the groin and armpits.\nHave the person lie down in a cool area with their feet slightly elevated.\nCool the person rapidly however you can.\nIntravenous (IV) fluids are often necessary to compensate for fluid or electrolyte loss. Bed rest is generally advised and body temperature may fluctuate abnormally for weeks after heat stroke.\n\nHow can heat stroke be prevented?\nThere are precautions that can help protect you against the adverse effects of heat stroke. These include the following\nDrink plenty of fluids during outdoor activities, especially on hot days. Water and sports drinks are the drinks of choice. Avoid caffeinated tea, coffee, soda, and alcohol, as these can lead to dehydration.\nWear lightweight, tightly woven, loose-fitting clothing in light colors.\nSchedule vigorous activity and sports for cooler times of the day.\nProtect yourself from the sun by wearing a hat, sunglasses and using an umbrella.\nIncrease time spent outdoors gradually to get your body used to the heat.\nDuring outdoor activities, take frequent drink breaks and mist yourself with a spray bottle to avoid becoming overheated.\nTry to spend as much time indoors as possible on very hot and humid days.\nNever leave children or pets in closed cars on warm or sunny days.\nIf you live in a hot climate and have a chronic condition, talk to your doctor about extra precautions you can take to protect yourself against heat stroke.", "\n\n1. When to Seek Immediate Medical Help\nSee a health care provider or go to a hospital emergency room if\nPain is severe or sudden or radiates into the abdomen.\nPain is accompanied by nausea and vomiting, urinary frequency or urgency, or painful urination.\nThere is swelling or bruising of the scrotum, or the scrotum or testicle is punctured.\\nn2. Treat Symptoms\nFor pain, take over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\nFor swelling, apply an ice pack to the scrotum.\n\n3. Provide Rest and Support\nThe person should wear supportive underwear.\nThe person should avoid strenuous activity.\n\n4. Follow Up\nSee a health care provider as soon as possible for mild pain.\nThe health care provider will examine the scrotum and testicles and may order blood and urine tests to check for infection.\nTreatment will depend on what's causing the problem.\n\nMore about Testicle Pains\nTesticular torsion is caused by the twisting of the testis and spermatic cord within the scrotum, with resulting in occlusion of venous return and and edema. If the It torsion persists, it can result in arterial occlusion and ischemia. Ischemia eventually leads to infarction and, resulting in decreased fertility due to loss of the testicle. Treatment of testicular torsion is a true urologic emergency, thus diagnosis and management and should not be delayed.\nNormally the testicle is anchored within the scrotum by the tunica vaginalis, which surrounds the testicle and attaches posteriorly to the scrotal wall and epididymis. The tunica vaginalis consists of a visceral and parietal layer with an interposed potential space. This potential space allows the testicle to rotate about the spermatic cord within the tunica vaginalis if a firm posterior scrotal attachment is lacking. When the tunica vaginalis attaches higher up on the spermatic cord, the testicle can move and twist within the scrotum (bell-clapper deformity). This places the testicle and spermatic cord at risk for torsion.\nThe appendix testes are embryonic remnants that have no known function and are located on the upper pole of the testicle. The appendix testes are prone to torsion as well, and the similar symptoms can be confused with torsion of the testicle.\n\nInitial Actions and Primary Survey\nObtain vital signs and IV access.\nPerform a focused history and physical examination\nIntravenous pain control\nOrder an ultrasound to assess for the presence or absence of vascular flow if the diagnosis is unclear.\nConsult urology early if torsion is suspected.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\nTesticular torsion\nTorsion of the appendix testis\nEpididymitis\nOrchitis\nRenal colic\nVaricoceleKidney stone\nAppendicitis\nHernia\nHydrocele\nTesticular trauma\n\nClassic Presentation\nTorsion is most common in the first year of life (including the prenatal period) and at puberty, although it can occur at any age. Patients often describe fairly sudden, severe unilateral testicular pain, sometimes radiating into the abdomen, associated with nausea and vomiting. They may also report urgency, frequency, and dysuria. The left testicle is more frequently affected. Torsion may result from direct trauma to the testicle, and the diagnosis may be delayed if the patient?s pain is attributed solely to the injury itself. A small number of patients will describe intermittent testicular pain that resolves spontaneously. This history is highly suspicious for torsion-detorsion and should be referred promptly to a urologist to avoid acute torsion and testicular ischemia and loss.\n physical examination, the patient is often in significant distress, and may have trouble walking due to severe pain. Always examine the unaffected testicle first in both the supine and standing position. The physical examination may be very difficult to perform since the patient frequently experiences a tremendous amount of discomfort. The testicle is usually exquisitely tender and swollen. It may sit higher within the scrotum than the opposite testis, and may have a transverse lie. Prehn?s sign describes the (relief of pain with elevation of the testicle and) was once to be touted as a method to distinguish epididyydimitis from torsion since the pain associated with torsion is usually not relieved with elevation of the testicle (ie, positive Prehn?s = epidiydyimitis). However, this sign is not reliable in differentiating these two entities. Several studies have found loss of the cremasteric reflex to be the most accurate sign of testicular torsion. This reflex is elicited by stroking the ipsilateral thigh which leads to reflex elevation of the ipsilateral testicle by greater than 0.5cm.\n\nTreatment\nAs with any emergency department patient, start with a primary assessment: airway, breathing, and circulation. Anyone with a suspected torsion should have an IV placed. Treat pain and nausea with IV medications, and keep the patient NPO in preparation for admission to the OR.\nIf you anticipate any delay in getting the patient to the OR, attempt manual detorsionperform a maneuver w which may temporarily restore some blood flow to the testicle: manual detorsion. The procedure is painful, so consider IV sedation or analgesia prior to attempting it. Have the patient lie supine, and stand facing towards the patient?s head. To manually detorse the testicle, grasp it gently and rotate it away from midline, as if you are opening a book. Most torsions involve one or more complete (360°) rotations. Therefore, you may need to make two or three complete rotations of the testicle. When the maneuver is successful, patients report dramatic pain relief within minutes. While most torsions occur toward the patient?s midline, a minority will twist in the opposite direction. Therefore, if it is difficult to untwist in one direction, try untwisting in the opposite direction.\nDefinitive treatment of testicular torsion is surgical. The testicle must be completely untwisted as soon as possible to restore blood flow. While there is no absolute cutoff to ensure viability, some studies have indicated that the best outcomes are achieved if the testicle is detorsed within 6 hours. If on surgical examination the testicular tissue is obviously necrotic, it may be removed. However, salvage is obviously desired and usually attempted. In addition, bilateral orchiopexy is usually done to prevent future torsion and preserve fertility.\n\nPearls and Pitfalls\nTo borrow a phrase, time is testicle (and fertility).

Follow Up\nAt the hospital, health care providers will rehydrate the person and continue cooling as needed.More about Heat Strokes\nHot Weather Health Emergencies\nEven short periods of high temperatures can cause serious health problems. During hot weather health emergencies, keep informed by listening to local weather and news channels or contact local health departments for health and safety updates. Doing too much on a hot day, spending too much time in the sun or staying too long in an overheated place can cause heat-related illnesses. Know the symptoms of heat disorders and overexposure to the sun, and be ready to give first aid treatment.\n\nHeat Stroke\nHeat stroke occurs when the body is unable to regulate its temperature. The body's temperature rises rapidly, the sweating mechanism fails, and the body is unable to cool down. Body temperature may rise to 106°F or higher within 10 to 15 minutes. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not provided.\nRecognizing Heat Stroke\nWarning signs of heat stroke vary but may include the following\nAn extremely high body temperature (above 103°F, orally)\nRed, hot, and dry skin (no sweating)\nRapid, strong pulse\nThrobbing headache\nDizziness\nNausea\nConfusion\nUnconsciousness\n\nWhat to Do\nIf you see any of these signs, you may be dealing with a life-threatening emergency. Have someone call for immediate medical assistance while you begin cooling the victim. Do the following\nGet the victim to a shady area.\nCool the victim rapidly using whatever methods you can. For example, immerse the victim in a tub of cool water; place the person in a cool shower; spray the victim with cool water from a garden hose; sponge the person with cool water; or if the humidity is low, wrap the victim in a cool, wet sheet and fan him or her vigorously.\nMonitor body temperature, and continue cooling efforts until the body temperature drops to 101-102°F.\nIf emergency medical personnel are delayed, call the hospital emergency room for further instructions.\nDo not give the victim fluids to drink.\nGet medical assistance as soon as possible.\nSometimes a victim's muscles will begin to twitch uncontrollably as a result of heat stroke. If this happens, keep the victim from injuring himself, but do not place any object in the mouth and do not give fluids. If there is vomiting, make sure the airway remains open by turning the victim on his or her side.\n\nHeat Exhaustion\nHeat exhaustion is a milder form of heat-related illness that can develop after several days of exposure to high temperatures and inadequate or unbalanced replacement of fluids. It is the body's response to an excessive loss of the water and salt contained in sweat. Those most prone to heat exhaustion are elderly people, people with high blood pressure, and people working or exercising in a hot environment.\n\nRecognizing Heat Exhaustion\nWarning signs of heat exhaustion include the following\nHeavy sweating\nPaleness\nMuscle cramps\nTiredness\nWeakness\nDizziness\nHeadache\nNausea or vomiting\nFainting\n\nThe skin may be cool and moist. The victim's pulse rate will be fast and weak, and breathing will be fast and shallow. If heat exhaustion is untreated, it may progress to heat stroke. Seek medical attention immediately if any of the following occurs\n\nSymptoms are severe\nThe victim has heart problems or high blood pressure\nOtherwise, help the victim to cool off, and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or last longer than 1 hour.", "\nVertigo: An unpleasant sensation of the world rotating, usually associated with nausea and vomiting. Vertigo usually is due to an issue with the inner ear. The common causes of vertigo are (in order):\nCall the doctor immedialty  if the person has\nA head injuryConvulsions\nChest pain\nChange in vision or speech\nFever over 101º F\nHeadache\nVery stiff neck\nInability to move an arm or leg\n\n1. Relieve or Prevent Dizziness\nHave the person lie down and rest.\nThe person should avoid sudden changes in body position.\nHelp the person avoid abrupt head movements, especially looking up.\n\n2. Keep the Person Safe\nHelp the person avoid falls.\nThe person should not drive or operate dangerous machinery.\n\n3. Call a Health Care Provider\nAny new signs and symptoms of vertigo should be checked by a health care provider.\n4. Follow Up\nThe health care provider may do a physical exam, hearing and balance tests, and possibly a CT or MRI scan.\n\nsymptoms\nThe symptoms of Ménière’s disease may be only a minor nuisance, or can become disabling, especially if the attacks of vertigo are severe, frequent, and occur without warning. Among them are\nAttacks of a spinning sensation or episodic rotational vertigo\nRoaring, buzzing or ringing sound in the ear or tinnitus\nSensation of fullness in the affected ear\nIntermittent hearing loss, especially in the low pitches during the early development stage\nFixed hearing loss involving all pitches in the advanced stage of the disease\nUncomfortable and distorted sounds.\nFrom all the Ménière’s disease’s symptoms, vertigo is usually the most troublesome. It is commonly produced by disorders of the inner ear, but may also occur in central nervous system disorders. Vertigo may last for 20 minutes to two hours or longer. During attacks, patients are usually unable to perform activities normal to their work or home life. Sleepiness may follow for several hours, and the off-balance sensation may last for days.\n\nMore about Vertigo\nWhat is the difference between dizziness, vertigo, and motion sickness?\nSome people describe a balance problem by saying they feel dizzy, lightheaded, unsteady, or giddy. This feeling of imbalance or disequilibrium is sometimes caused by an inner ear problem. Others describe their balance problem by using the word vertigo, which comes from the Latin verb to turn. They often say that they or their surroundings are turning or spinning. Vertigo can also be triggered by problems in the inner ear.\nMotion sickness is a common medical problem associated with travel. Some people experience nausea and even vomiting when riding in an airplane, automobile, boat, or amusement park ride. Motion sickness is usually just a minor annoyance and does not signify any serious medical illness, but some travelers are incapacitated by it. A few even suffer symptoms for a few days after the trip.\n\nHow does the body maintain its equilibrium?\nDizziness, vertigo, and motion sickness all relate to the sense of balance and equilibrium. Researchers in space and aeronautical medicine call this sense spatial orientation, because it tells the brain where the body is in space: what direction it is pointing, what direction it is moving, and if it is turning or standing still.\n\nYour sense of balance is maintained by a complex interaction of the following parts of the nervous system\nThe inner ears (also called the labyrinth), which monitor the directions of motion, such as turning, or forward-backward, side-to-side, and up-and-down motions.\nThe eyes, which monitor where the body is in space (i.e. upside down, rightside up, etc.) and also directions of motion.\nThe skin pressure receptors such as in the joints and spine, which tell what part of the body is down and touching the ground.\nThe muscle and joint sensory receptors, which tell what parts of the body are moving.The central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), which processes all the bits of information from the four other systems to make some coordinated sense out of it all.The symptoms of motion sickness and dizziness appear when the central nervous system receives conflicting messages from the other four systems. For example, suppose you are riding through a storm, and your airplane is being tossed about by air turbulence. But your eyes do not detect all this motion because all you see is the inside of the airplane. Then your brain receives messages that do not match with each other. You might become air sick. Or, to use a true medical condition as an example, suppose you suffer inner ear damage on only one side from a head injury or an infection. The damaged inner ear does not send the same signals as the healthy ear. This gives conflicting signals to the brain about the sensation of rotation, and you could suffer a sense of spinning, vertigo, and nausea.\n\nWhat medical conditions cause dizziness?\nCirculation— If your brain does not get enough blood flow, you feel light headed. Almost everyone has experienced this on occasion when standing up quickly from a lying down position. But some people have light headedness from poor circulation on a frequent or chronic basis. This could be caused by arteriosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, and it is commonly seen in patients who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or high levels of blood fats (cholesterol). It is sometimes seen in patients with inadequate cardiac (heart) function or with anemia.\nCertain drugs also decrease the blood flow to the brain, especially stimulants such as nicotine and caffeine. Excess salt in the diet also leads to poor circulation. Sometimes circulation is impaired by spasms in the arteries caused by emotional stress, anxiety, and tension.\nIf the inner earfalls to receive enough blood flow, the more specific type of dizziness occurs-that is-vertigo. The inner ear is very sensitive to minor alterations of blood flow and all of the causes mentioned for poor circulation to the brain also apply specifically to the inner ear.\nInjury— A skull fracture that damages the inner ear produces a profound and incapacitating vertigo with nausea and hearing loss. The dizziness will last for several weeks, then slowly improve as the normal (other) side takes over.\nInfection: Viruses, such as those causing the common cold or flu, can attack the inner ear and its nerve connections to the brain. This can result in severe vertigo, but hearing is usually spared. However, a bacterial infection such as mastoiditis that extends into the inner ear will completely destroy both the hearing and the equilibrium function of that ear. The severity of dizziness and recovery time will be similar to that of skull fracture.\nAllergy— Some people experience dizziness and/or vertigo attacks when they are exposed to foods or airborne particles (such as dust, molds, pollens, danders, etc.) to which they are allergic.\nNeurological diseases— A number of diseases of the nerves can affect balance, such as multiple sclerosis, syphilis, tumors, etc. These are uncommon causes, but your physician will think about them during the examination.\n\nWhat kind of a medical examination can I expect?\nThe doctor will ask you to describe your symptoms, whether it is light headedness or a sensation of motion, how long and how often the dizziness has troubled you, how long a dizzy episode lasts, and whether it is associated with hearing loss or nausea and vomiting. You might be asked to cite specific circumstances that induce a dizzy spell. You will also be questioned about your general health, medicines you are taking, head injuries, recent infections, etc.\nThe physician will examine your ears, nose, and throat and do tests of nerve and balance function. Because the inner ear controls both balance and hearing, disorders of balance often affect hearing and vice versa. Therefore, your physician might recommend hearing tests or audiograms. Depending on your diagnosis, the physician might order skull X rays, a CT or MRI scan of your head, or special tests of eye motion after warm or cold water is used to stimulate the inner ear (ENG - electronystagmography). In some cases, blood tests or a heart evaluation might be recommended.\n\nTips to reduce dizzy spells\nAvoid rapid changes in position, especially from lying down to standing up or turning around from one side to the other.\nAvoid extremes of head motion (especially looking up) or rapid head motion (especially turning or twisting).\nEliminate or decrease use of products that impair circulation, e.g. nicotine, caffeine, and salt.\nMinimize your exposure to circumstances that precipitate your dizziness, such as stress and anxiety or substances to which you are allergic.\nAvoid hazardous activities when you are dizzy, such as driving an automobile or operating dangerous equipment, or climbing a step ladder, etc.\nTips to alleviate motion sickness\nAlways ride where your eyes will see the same motion that your body and inner ears feel, e.g. sit in the front seat of the car and look at the distant scenery; go up on the deck of the ship and watch the horizon; sit by the window of the airplane and look outside. In an airplane, choose a seat over the wings where the motion is the least.\nDo not read while traveling if you are subject to motion sickness, and do not sit in a seat facing backward.\nDo not watch or talk to another traveler who is having motion sickness.\nAvoid strong odors and spicy or greasy foods immediately before and during your travel. Medical research has not yet investigated the effectiveness of popular folk remedies such as soda crackers and Seven Up® or cola syrup over ice.\nTake one of the varieties of motion sickness medicines before your travel begins, as recommended by your physician. Some of these medications can be purchased without a prescription (i.e., Dramamine®, Bonine®, Marezine®, etc.) Stronger medicines such as tranquilizers and nervous system depressants will require a prescription from your physician. Some are used in pill or suppository form.", "\nCuts or Lacerations Treatment\nCall the doctor immedialty  if the person has\nA cut is bleeding severely\nBlood is spurting out\nBleeding can't be stopped after 10 minutes of firm and steady pressure\nIn general, a cut that needs stitches should be repaired within 6 hours of the injury. The exception is cuts to the face and scalp, which generally can be repaired up to 24 hours after the injury.\n\nTake the following steps for minor cuts.\n1. Stop the Bleeding\nApply direct pressure on the area\n\n2. Clean and Protect\nClean the area with warm water and gentle soap.\nApply an antibiotic ointment to reduce chance of infection.\nPut a sterile bandage on the area. In some people, antibiotic ointments may cause a rash. If this happens, stop using the ointment.\n\n3. Call a Health Care Provider\nCall a health care provider if\nThe cut is deep or over a joint\nYou cannot get the cut or laceration clean\nThe injury is a deep puncture wound or the person has not had a recent (within the last 5 to 10 years) tetanus shot or booster\nThe cut is from a human or animal bite\n\n4. Follow Up\nFor a minor cut or laceration, remove bandage after a couple of days to promote healing.\nSee a health care provider if the cut doesn't heal or shows signs of infection, including redness, swelling, pus, or excessive pain.\n\nMore about Cuts Wounds and Puntures \nCut and Puncture Wound Causes \nAlmost any type of sharp object can cause a cut or puncture wound. Nails, tacks, glass, wooden splinters and scissors are common objects of concern, as are animal bites.\nSymptoms of Cuts and Puncture Wounds\nPuncture wounds cause bleeding, pain and, in some cases, a loss of feeling around the site of the wound. An infected wound will appear red and swollen and might be full of pus or a watery discharge.\n\nTreatment of Cuts and Puncture Wounds\nTreatment depends on the severity of the cut. The first step is to stop the wound from bleeding by applying direct pressure. If the wound is deep and bleeds excessively, medical attention is required.\nBecause cuts and puncture wounds are particularly prone to infection, it is important that they be thoroughly cleaned. The wound should be run under water for approximately five minutes and the surrounding area cleaned with soap and water. All objects must be removed from the wound, but it’s important not to poke at or inside of it. Clearing the wound of all debris can greatly reduce the risk of infection. If rinsing with water does not effectively remove all objects, seeking treatment from a doctor so that the lodged item can be removed is necessary.\nOnce cleaned, a thin layer of antibacterial ointment applied to the area will protect it against infection. A clean bandage covering the surface of the wound will help keep it clean and free from harmful bacteria. The bandage should be changed daily or when it becomes dirty or wet.\n\nWhen to Contact a Doctor\nIf the wound has been caused by a human or animal bite, it’s imperative to see a doctor immediately. Exposure to rabies is of particular concern if a stray dog or wild animal inflicted the bite, and in such cases antibiotics and/or a rabies vaccination series could be administered.\nA doctor should be called right away in cases when the wound is large or deep (even if it’s not bleeding) or when it appears that stitches might be needed. Usually, a wound that is more than an inch deep or that reaches the bone will require stitches.\nIf the object that punctured the skin is still embedded in the wound, a doctor should be contacted right away.\nIf a rusty object, such as a nail or fishhook, caused the puncture wound, a physician should examine it. A tetanus booster might be required if the patient hasn’t had one within the past 10 years.\nFinally, if the wound shows signs of infection, which include redness, swelling and draining pus, a doctor should be consulted.\n\nWhen to Seek Emergency Care\nBleeding does not stop after applying direct pressure for more than 15 minutes.\nThe puncture wound is gaping and muscle or tissue can be seen.\nAnything but a very small wound on the head, chest or stomach is suffered.\nAn object, such as a piece of glass, is stuck inside the wound, or the wound cannot be properly cleaned at home.\nThe wound becomes infected after 24 hours, and the individual develops a fever of more than 100° F."};
